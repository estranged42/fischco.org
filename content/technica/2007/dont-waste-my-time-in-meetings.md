I read a great <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/08/31/the_laptop_herring.html">article on meetings today</a>.  Best quote for me is near the end.

> A meeting must fight to exist. It must defend its existence to its attendees who should constantly be asking “Why are we here?”

I'm fortunate enough to work in a <a href="http://oscr.arizona.edu">great organization</a> that has very rarely wasted my time.  As we grow however, we constantly have to evaluate what we do, and why we do it.
