This is a personal project page for my PyBadge Twitter experiments. The goal is to see if I can get data out of twitter (mentions, tags, maybe profile pictures) and display them on a [PyBadge][].

Twitter has some requirements for creating a developer account and application for using the Twitter API these days, so this page serves to satisfy those requirements.
