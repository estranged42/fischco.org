## Overview

In this article I will discuss the evolution of this website through its current migration from Squarespace to a static website built by [hugo][] and hosted in AWS [S3][]. We'll look at the pros and cons of Squarespace vs static HTML sites, and talk about why I chose hugo over the many other static site generators.

## History of fischco.org

The fischco.org website here has been through many iterations over its lifetime. It began back in 2002/2003 as a [PHPNuke][] site, although the earliest surviving post is from 2004. Then I migrated it to [serendipity][] for a while. Then I briefly drank the [Wordpress][] cool-aid and migrated to that for a few years. I did all this at a time when I was a working web developer & programmer. At some point I got tired of coming home after building websites and having to patch my own website. While I still wanted to have my own website, I got tired of having to maintain my own website. So I signed up for [Squarespace][] and breathed a sigh of relief for many years!
