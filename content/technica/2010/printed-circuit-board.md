I got my first printed circuit board (PCB) design in the mail today.  This is for a pretty simple blinking LED project.  
 
When [UITS][] got its new logo, the dancing circuit people just screamed out to be made into a real PCB somehow.  This is what I came up with.  I realize using a full [Arduino][] ATMega168 is a bit overkill for driving some LEDs, but I decided that I'd rather get a prototype working this year instead of deciphering datasheets for the smaller ATtiny series for the next 6 months.

The basic idea is to just have the color changing LEDs fade between red and blue in various patterns.  Pushing the button will cycle through a couple different blink patterns.
 
I got these boards printed at [BatchPCB][].  If you're only wanting 1 or 2 small boards, they're hard to beat for price.  $45 for two boards, and they ended up sending me 4!  Took about 20 days for them to get here, but they look great!
