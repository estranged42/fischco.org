I went to the pediatrician with Mark and Kirin so I wouldnt be bored at home. She now weighs 7lbs 4 oz. She gained 12 oz over the week. She is also longer, 20 inches. Grow Baby Grow! 

Then we went to Michael's craft store. I got some new beads, watercolor pencils, stamps, paper and envelopes. Now I just need Marky to print up more baby pictures for me. I am slowly making baby picture cards and sending them to family and friends. If you dont have one yet, dont panic! I plan to get one to everybody, but that will take some time. If you dont have one in 2-3 weeks, then remind me. The memory is a little fuzzy lately.

Kirin was very well behaved at the Dr's and at the store. Of course, we hurried to leave once she started looking fussy. But it was a successful outing. Except for Mark's wallet. I'll have to be content with the projects I have for another month at least! :smile: Kirin likes riding in the car. It puts her to sleep almost instantly. It's a little hard on Mark trying to get Mom and baby, wheelchair and stroller into the car, but he's pretty organized about it. Takes 10 mins to load or unload, but we can get out of the house now.
