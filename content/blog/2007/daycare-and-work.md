Well, Angela is doing really well.  She's feeling good enough to actually start going back to work in a limited fashion. Unfortunately, the original idea of bringing Kirin to work with her isn't really going to work they decided.  I had doubts about this idea, so it's not really surprising to me, but still it means we had to seriously start looking at daycare.

Daycare for a vulnerable little person who is not quite 4 months old scares the bejeezers out of the both of us.  You interview friends, find out who they trust, visit the place, see good things... but when you drop off your daughter with a relative stranger and have to walk away while she's screaming her head off... well its pretty much one of the hardest things I've had to do in my life.

I think I'm taking it slightly better than Angela, she had a real hard time going this morning, even though we were close to being late to her doc appointment.  Countless parents and children go through this routine ever day, and have for centuries.  Daycare is just a modern extension of 'the village'.  It doesn't make it any easier though, and you can't help but feel that you're being a bad parent.

We'll see how it goes.  The daycare people say today went better than yesterday, and we're taking her in for a short time tomorrow, even though we don't really have to.  Angela plans on working 3 days a week, and I'm going to try and stay home one of those days.  That limits our daycare to only two days a week for the most part, with the occasional 3rd day thrown in there I'm sure for emergencies.

Well, we'll keep you posted on how it works out!
