Angela's brother came to visit last week.  He and his wife had their first daughter about a year ago now, and Katie is big!  They have been such a help to us by sending us TONS of baby stuff.  Clothes, sheets, playpens, rockers, bassinets, toys, more clothes, bottles, you name it.  Kirin and Katie got along great, and we have a few awesome pictures of them on the couch.

Later that weekend, Angela's parents came down again for Mother's day.  They helped out a bunch by cleaning.  Angela was all glowy for her first mother's day!  Kirin slept through most of it.
