Kirin went to the doctor last week and weighed in at 10 pounds. She is growing quickly. This puts her squarely in the 50th percentile for size. She also got a bunch of shots. Poor thing! She didn't like that much but she calmed down quickly. They gave her the cutest little spot band-aids! Every one smiles when they see Mark pushing my wheelchair while I push the baby stroller! Got to get a picture of that.

We all went to the orthopedist on Tuesday. The x-rays are looking good. The doc said I can walk while wearing my fancy boot and start physical therapy. HURRAY!! I have been walking about cautiously since then using my walker. I hope when I feel stronger and get used to walking again that I can get rid of the walker. Maybe use a cane instead. I feel like a granny! In physical therapy I get to play in the pool. I'll get to walk in the water without the boot! The doc hopes to get rid of the boot in another 4 weeks or so.

So now that I am up and moving around, I have to think about the full-time job offer I got from my favorite place to work. They say I can bring little Kirin to work with me. I just don't know how that will work out.
As for the big picture, things are looking better!
