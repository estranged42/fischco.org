We finally got Angela and Kirin out of the hospital today.  Everyone is doing well and is resting comfortably at home.  Many thanks to Mom, Dad, Mom &amp; Dad for getting the house cleaned up and ready to go for us.  Dave and John installed grab bars in both bathrooms to help while Angela is still hobbling around, and Marty &amp; Jan got the house all cleaned up great.  Big thanks to Michelle for watching dogs and Angela and Kirin while I was off running errands the past few weeks.  Thanks also to Kim, Michelle, Annette, Z, Limell, Catherine &amp; Betsy for all the help over the past 3 weeks.
