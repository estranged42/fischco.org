So this is my new journal site. All finished with the pregnancy site. 9 months of that was long enough. Time to move on. I'll try not to bore you with the daily trivia and stick to the interesting things.

Kirin's umbilical cord fell off today. She is officially hatched! She is growing, and eating (!), well. Her 2 week check up is tomorrow. Should have new numbers on her weight. She and Mark will probably go by themselves to the doctor. It's such a hassle to get me out and about. My leg and boot dont quite fit in the little saturn yet. Michele took me to the surgeon yesterday in her car. its a little easier. Heh, we got stuck in the elevator at the dr's office. Im sucha bad penny. At least they got us out quick. Then we went to my office and saw all my co-workers and had some fun with them. Sucha long day makes the foot ache pretty good but it was nice to be out and about a little.
