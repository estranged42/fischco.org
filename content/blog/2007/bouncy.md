Kirin got a new bouncy plaything yesterday.  She's getting to the point where she really wants to be sitting upright, and she isn't liking sitting in the swing or other chair we have much these days.  She still likes the swing for getting to sleep, but during the day she definitely would rather be sitting up.

There's a short <a href="/wp/kirin-bouncy-chair-video/">video of her playing in her new chair</a> also.
