Kirin Hale Fischer was born Thursday, April 19th at 3:15pm.  She weighed 7lbs 3oz, and is 19 inches long.  Angela and I are overwhelmed, and extremely happy!  We're also extremely tired!  We'll probably be in the hospital until next Monday or Tuesday, because of Angela's broken ankle.  As soon as she is well enough we'll all come home.  So enough writing, on with the pictures.
