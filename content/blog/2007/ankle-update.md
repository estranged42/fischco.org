Good news and bad news about the ankle.

Good News! The pins and bones and things are all well placed and the xrays look fine. The inside of my ankle looks like construction scaffolding, but it will do for a while. I am allowed to wash the whole thing now. So I washed it in freezing water yesterday! Oh that felt GOOD! Got it nice and NUMB! I am also allowed to do simple exercises with it 3 times a day. The doc says he is only permiting me to do some of these things because I AM a therapist. He wouldnt trust a regular patient to do the exercises by themselves at this point.

Bad news  :cry:

The bone in my ankle is osteoporotic. I'll probably need a bone scan this year to check out the rest of my bones. What this means now, is that the bone will heal very slowly. The doc thinks it may be a total of 12 or 16 weeks before I am allowed to put weight on it. This is week 4 since the surgery.
In the meantime, I am drinking lots of milk and orange juice with calcium, taking vitamins, glucosamin chondroitin and doing the exercises to encourage the bones to grow.
