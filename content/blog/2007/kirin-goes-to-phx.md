We finally got up to Phoenix this past weekend.  Angela's grandmother Carol finally got to see Kirin.  Kirin has great grandparents!  Its a bit too hot still to really travel comfortably with Kirin, and the last few miles she was getting pretty unhappy.  All in all she traveled very well.  We went to Tracy's birthday party Saturday evening, then stopped by the Fischer abode for an early dinner, then alas it was back to Tucson.
