It's my birthday time!  June 6<sup>th</sup> falls on a Wednesday this year, so I'm thinking about doing a party thing on the following Saturday, June 9<sup>th</sup>.  I don't think we're going to do a huge fancy party like we did for 30.  It's just too much work right now with a new baby and all.  So I'm thinking about doing just a rolling get together.  If you've been looking for a good excuse to come by and see Kirin, this is it!  I think we'll be ready for visitors by about 1pm, so any time after that, probably until 8pm or so, just stop by, say hi, have a drink, play some Warcraft etc.
My <a href="/wp/mark-birthday/">birthday list</a>
 is up on the side here, and <a href="http://www.machomestore.com/catalog/index.php">MacHomeStore.com</a>
 is having a Memorial Day sale on all the remote switch stuff.
Don't sweat presents and stuff, we're much happier with the visiting at this point.  I think we're both feeling a little cabin fever.  I've put up a <a href="/wp/map-to-house/map-to-our-house-on-eli-st/">map to our house
 on the right side menu.
