We went to rocky point this past week and had a blast. We traded in another week of our timeshare and stayed at the [Mayan Palace][1] in Puerto Penasco, Mexico. The resort was really nice, but its not finished yet. The wing we stayed in didn't have it's heat until the day before we left. We had a couple space heaters though, and we didn't freeze.

We spent most of the week sitting in our room doing nothing. It was great! We read books, slept, ordered room service a lot, and played video games. We brough our Xbox down with us and hooked it up to their TV. A week of doing nothing is a great stress reliever, and I recommend it to everyone!

We did take some trips into town, where we bought some neat stuff for our new house. [pics to come of that!]. We also took one boat ride out to bird island with the folks at [Lobo Del Mar][1]. There are a ton of birds there, and about two thousand sea lions year round. One of the birds is the Blue Footed Boobie, which is endangered, and a big reasion why the islands are a wildlife sanctuary in Mexico.

The sea lions pups are really friendly. It was a shame the weather was so cold, because you can go snorkeling with them and they'll play with you.
