We finally got around to getting our back yard landscaped.  [Arid Plant Designs][1] did it, and they did a great job.  We finally have something in the back yard other than dirt!  We even have grass!  I'm pretty happy having some grass for Kirin and the dogs to play in.  I'll post some better stills tomorrow.
