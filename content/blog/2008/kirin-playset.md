We went to the park today.  Kirin actually climbed up onto the play-set, and then
proceeded to climb all over it.  Its pretty amazing how large of a step she can scramble
up now.  I'll get some more pictures posted soon.

*update*: I've got more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/">pictures uploaded to flickr</a>, 
along with some vids below.
