We're in week 11 now.  We had the second checkup appointment today. We got to hear a heartbeat with a sound-o-scope thing the doc had, it was pretty cool!  The baby's heartbeat is about twice as fast as normal at this stage, growing like a crazy thing.  Everything seems to be progressing well, altho Angela has been pretty tired the past few weeks.  Everyone we've talked to said that's pretty normal, most of them spent the first trimester nauseous and in bed.  The second trimester is coming up though and most people say she should start to feel better soon.

No new pictures this time, but at 20-22 weeks we should be able to get a better ultrasound, and find out the gender!
