We got a new sonogramothing of our daughter a few weeks ago.  I uploaded it to my [Flickr][1] account a little while ago, and that got me thinking.  With all the privacy concerns these days, I'm not sure how publc I want pictures of my children to be.  Its one thing for parents to embarras their kids in front of their family (and likely their friends), but I think its another thing to embarras them in front of the world.

So I'm only going to post most pictures privately to my flickr account.  Unfortunately that means that people will have to create a Flickr account, ask me to add them to my family and friends list, and then they can login and see the images.  I know its a lot of hoops to jump through, but I think its probably best.

I'm not sure the steps to asking me for a friends invite... if you send me an email requesting it I can send you the instructions from inside Flickr I think, or post a comment here.
