We're pretty much moved into the new house.  We [put the old house up for sale][1] last weekend, so that's underway.  We have a little bit of stuff to get out of the old garage, and LOTS of boxes to unpack at the new place.  We still need to get an electrician out to hookup our dryer, I had to put up a clothesline today. :smile:

Today I get to put shelves together in the new house and unpack our books.  Fun stuffs!
