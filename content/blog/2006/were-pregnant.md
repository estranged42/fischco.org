Yep that's right, Angela & Mark are having a baby.  :smile:

We found out for sure a few weeks ago, and today went in for our first checkup.  At a whopping 7 weeks, you can already see a heartbeat, even though it's only about the size of your pinky's fingernail.  Needless to say we're both very excited/anxious!

You can just make out the kid (its the larger of the two blobs in the middle) in the ultrasound photo.  So thus begins our grand adventure into the realm of parenthood!
