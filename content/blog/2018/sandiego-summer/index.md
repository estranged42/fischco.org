We headed over to San Diego again this summer for the week of the 4th of July. Mostly hanging out with Angela's family, hitting the Zoo and the beach!

We stayed in a small hotel on Shelter Island, with a little beach right nearby. Of course the girls immediately ran off and got soaked in the sand.
