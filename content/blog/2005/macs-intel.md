I found this article today <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2005/06/microsoft_intel.html">I found this article today</a> and it made me laugh.  Most of you know I'm a pretty big mac head, so the whole <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html">announcement from apple that they will be moving to Intel CPUs</a> has me fairly interested.  All in all I think it can be a good thing or a bad thing.  I'm betting on the good thing because I'm an optimist.  Over the years apple has moved more and more towards standard components (SCSI drives to ATA, standard memory, USB, PCI, AGP, etc) so moving to a more standard processor architecture is sort of the next step.  I for one am hoping that it will be easier to develop drivers for video cards now than it has been in the past.  Nothing frustrated us mac heads more than having to wait 6 months to use a new video card because there were no drivers yet (of course in 6 months there was a NEW new video card...).

The whole virtualization thing will be interesting to watch also.  It has been widely quoted that <a href="http://news.com.com/Apple+throws+the+switch%2C+aligns+with+Intel+-+page+2/2100-7341_3-5733756-2.html?tag=st.next">Apple will not do anything to prevent people from running Windows</a> on an Apple made Intel machine.  Things like Virtual PC will also run much better.  So we may ned up seeing more people switch to Apple hardware for the added flexibility of running Windows/MacOS/Linux.  On the other hand, game developers may not feel the need to port games to the mac, they may tell people to go install Windows on your mac and run the games in Windows.

The reverse will also be true eventually.  People out there with more geek power than I will invariably figure out how to run MacOS on non-apple hardware. (dell, gateweay, etc)  Hopefully this will be difficult enough that only die-hard hardware people will even try, like soldering a mod-chip onto your motherboard.

We have a year to wait pretty much to see what will happen.  So in the mean time... back to work.
