One of our good friends from high school, Toni, came into Phx this weekend, and managed to get a bunch of us [Brophy][] / [Xavier][] (websites!  ha!) people together for drinks!  We had: Toni, Jayce, Ian, Dominic, Sarah, Adam, Angela, and Myself.  We had an awesome time.  We all met up at Dominic's house, which was semi frightening for me considering the last time I was there I managed to break his tooth.  Long story.  I half expected his parents to greet me saying "Hey we remember you, you knocked our kid's tooth out!" I was safe however, since Dominic's parents now spend the hot Phoenix summers in Ireland!

We all piled into cars and drove to a local bar where we talked and drank and ate, and drank, and talked, you get the idea.  After a few rounds it was back into the cars and back to Dom's house.  It was then that someone discovered the yearbooks.  Now it was horribly un-fair that only Brophy yearbooks were available, as the guys suffered through many hours of taunting.  We survived mostly by making fun of everyone who wasn't there. (Jason, <s>Jim</s> [Hart][], Andr√©, Mike, the list goes on...)  I must go find Angela's yearbooks...

Toni took pictures, and as soon as she gets them posted I will link to them here, so check back!

Here's to another decade!
