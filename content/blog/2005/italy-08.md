Saturday 15 Oct Greve
=====================================

Today we left late. Sleep is good.  Another fast trip up the Autostrada, around Florence to the south, and down route 222 to Greve. Deep in Chianti country, Greve has a wine museum and a tasting room.  The museum has tools, books, bottles and other paraphernalia dating back to the late 1800s.

The wine tasting involves buying a mag-stripe card and walking around to the six kiosks. You insert your card and press the button on the wine you wish to sample. It is dispensed, and the cost is deducted from your card.

The latest edition was the 2000 Banfi, accompanied by the 1997, 1995 and 1993. These four tastings wiped 2/3 of our card. Oh, well, it was worth it.

In the process, we picked up a bottle of Marchese Antinori Chianti Classico 2000. It was 30% less than in the states, and a great value. We will leave it as a gift for the owner of our apartment, as she done a wonderful job for her clientele.

We wandered around town (a favorite pastime in Tuscany), ate lunch, and wandered back home.

After naps, some wine and cheese by the fire (Angela found a wheelbarrow, and we have enough wood for the next week), Carl, Ann, Marty and Dave went out for dinner. 7:30 PM is early. The restaurant had just opened, and we were first in the door. Not for long. It filled up nicely.

The first course was two orders of mixed antipasto meats and two orders of mixed seafood. We ended up with 10 or 12 small dishes with two pieces on each platter. Some shrimps in a sauce, some squid strips in a salad, some beans, some boar, some ...well it was really neat. Lastly, Marty had a pasta and Porcini mushroom dish, and the rest of us had a mixed seafood grill. All very nice.
