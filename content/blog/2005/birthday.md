Well, I can no longer call myself &quot;20-something&quot;.  Yay for turning 30.  Angela threw an awesome party for me though!  Most everyone from work came, and friends from out of town too.  We had Star Wars theme for the party!  We had star wars cake, and star wars lego, and star wars masks, and star wars pinatas, and star wars costumes!  I will have to steal some pictures.  I managed to sneak in a bit of geekie-ness too and caught a time-lapse of the whole party! I of course got tons of star wars presents!  Most notable are a star wars Mr. Potato Head (Darth Tater) and the Lego Millennium Falcon.  I have a [time lapse of me putting the Falcon together too][1], and I'll put that up eventually.
