So I finally got around to playing with the website tonight.  I realized that what I really wanted was a simple place to put up notes, and to allow other people in the family to do the same.  So I have installed some new blogging software, and we'll see how that goes.  I have to create accounts by hand right now, so if you want an account and your own blog let me know!  I will start copying over my other entries from the old system tomorrow.
