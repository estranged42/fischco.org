<h3 class="entry-title post-title">The Night Before (The War On) Christmas</h3>

&lsquo;Twas the night before Christmas; the Christians all hunkered <br>
In basements of buildings they&rsquo;d armored and bunkered. <br>
They huddled in silence; they huddled in fear, <br>
With thoughts that the atheists soon would draw near <br>
 <br>
The War Against Christmas had started on Fox&mdash; <br>
Just a couple of fools on the idiot-box <br>
Who were looking for noise to give ratings a boost&mdash; <br>
But lately, those chickens have come home to roost: <br>
 <br>
Believers are frightened; they&rsquo;re panicked; they&rsquo;re scared, <br>
And not one among them will go unprepared; <br>
They&rsquo;ve heard that the atheists roam, Christmas night, <br>
So Christians stay hidden, and safe out of sight. <br>
 <br>
It&rsquo;s serious business, the whole Christmas season, <br>
When people of faith fend off people of reason&mdash; <br>
At least, that&rsquo;s the story you hear on TV, <br>
So the basement&rsquo;s the place meant for children to be <br>
 <br>
There&rsquo;ll be no &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Away in the Manger&rdquo; <br>
The godless might hear it! Consider the danger! <br>
And then, they&rsquo;d attack&mdash;Why, they&rsquo;ve done it for years, <br>
With that vile &ldquo;Season&rsquo;s Greetings!&rdquo; invading the ears! <br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Happy Holidays!&rdquo; may seem inclusive and nice, <br>
But it just isn&rsquo;t Christmas, unless it&rsquo;s got Christ; <br>
Those words are no less than a form of assault! <br>
So it&rsquo;s war (and it&rsquo;s clearly the atheists&rsquo; fault!) <br>
 <br>
(Plus, it&rsquo;s unpatriotic, and now it&rsquo;s high time <br>
We made non-Christian greetings a federal crime! <br>
The clear, true intent of our great founding fathers&mdash; <br>
Which someone should check, although nobody bothers) <br>
 <br>
The elders remember an earlier time, <br>
When a bottle of Coke only cost you a dime, <br>
Each Christmas the snowfall was brilliant and white <br>
And there wasn&rsquo;t an atheist heathen in sight! <br>
 <br>
Folks visited neighbors; they caroled with friends; <br>
They hand-crafted gifts out of old odds and ends; <br>
They knew that the joys of the season would last&hellip; <br>
But now, such delights are a thing of the past. <br>
 <br>
There are rifles to oil; there is ammo to check; <br>
There&rsquo;s a radio, straining to tune in Glen Beck; <br>
No time to sing carols, or even say prayers, <br>
With the danger that some may be caught unawares! <br>
 <br>
A war&mdash;manufactured, but war nonetheless&mdash; <br>
Could kill hundreds, or thousands, it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess; <br>
They&rsquo;re under attack, and that is the reason <br>
They&rsquo;re locked and they&rsquo;re loaded, the whole Christmas season! <br>
 <br>
The atheists, meanwhile, are feasting and singing; <br>
Our stockings are hung and our sleigh-bells are ringing&mdash; <br>
Though Jesus had nothing to do with a sleigh, <br>
We&rsquo;re all unbelievers, and so it&rsquo;s ok! <br>
 <br>
With holly, and eggnog, and mistletoe kisses, <br>
We&rsquo;ll watch &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful life" (just like <em>this</em> is) <br>
With family and friends&mdash;with the people who love us&mdash; <br>
With no one beneath us, nor no one above us <br>
 <br>
We&rsquo;ll celebrate all the things Christmas is for, <br>
Like giving, and loving, not hatred or war <br>
And we&rsquo;ll say to the world (cos we&rsquo;ve got every right): <br>
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! <br>
 <br>
 <br>
