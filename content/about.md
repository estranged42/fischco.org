# Mark Fischer

Mark Fischer is a cloud architect at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. Mark has 20 years of experience in the technology space, starting with a foundation in building early web applications, through the Web 2.0 craze, and on to today's API and microservices driven architectures. Along the way he's been bringing automation to the infrastructure side of things, and has been helping to lead the University of Arizona's cloud migration since 2015.

He's the lucky husband to Angela and father of two crazy little girls. One of these days he will get his woodworking hobby off the ground.
