BODY:
<p>The plan is to ruminate and cogitate upon some of the things I have been reading lately. I have started writing in my paper journal as time and ideas permit. I intend to edit and upload it here. The paper version may be more convenient. However, quite a lot of the things I wish to ponder can be found on the internet and linking to other articles is just too useful to ignore. &nbsp;Hopefully, dumping some of these ideas onto &#8216;paper&#8217; will stop them from rattling around in my sleep deprived mind at 4 am.</p>
<p>Again, the plan was to begin with some thoughts on the introductory quotation in Victor Stenger&#8217;s The New Atheism: Taking a Stand for Science and Reason. I do plan to do that in the near future. Instead, this morning when I sat down with pen and paper (!) I started at the beginning. The first page concerns childhood, mine and my children&#8217;s. That shall be the first real post I think. It may require referencing Dawkin&#8217;s chapter in The God Delusion regarding the indoctrination of children into religion.The more practical need to determine the proper way to raise children may take precedence over the simple intellectual pleasure of philosophizing. &nbsp;On to Plan B.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shall continue to write on paper over the next few days and then post a more coherent version of my thoughts about childhood. &nbsp;We shall see what develops.</p>

<p>Chapter 9 Childhood, Abuse and the Escape from Religion</p>
<p>I can attest that three year olds don&#8217;t come with religion. In fact, they don&#8217;t come with civilization. It is a parents responsibility to teach and lead by example as best they can.</p>
<p>I clearly remember being an atheist at the age of 8 years old. I was raised pretty much free of religion. I don&#8217;t recall ever going to church until high school. My only exposure to religion prior to Catholic High School was the secular celebrations of Christmas and Easter. Possibly I went to church once or twice with my Catholic grandparents, but I can&#8217;t really be sure. </p>
<p>There are so many things children need to learn in this society. All those basic skills of eating, dressing, living together and everything else in Kindergarten. How does a religious education at this age benefit a pre-schooler? We read quite a few stories with morals and lessons. Thus far, I have avoided traditional children&#8217;s bible stories. I don&#8217;t see how Noah&#8217;s Ark will benefit a child who is unaware of this God character. Besides, what does it teach that she needs? God (Who&#8217;s that?) will punish you and then reward you for various strange behaviors? How did Noah get all those animals on a boat anyway?</p>
<p>Marty believes the children should be exposed to these ideas. To that end, she brought over Mark&#8217;s old book of children&#8217;s stories and his bible. However, as far as I know, Kirin has no concept of God and has never asked about it.  Considering she asks about everything else (including car fairies), I would expect her to ask if she wanted to know. So I don&#8217;t know what effect these stories would have on her.</p>
<p>I think allowing her to stay in a state of original ignorance for as long as possible is best. I hope this will prevent the idea from deeply taking root when she does encounter it.</p>

<p>Observation: Children do not come equipped with the idea of god, nor indeed civilized behavior.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Concept of god not necessary for preschool age child to begin integration into her society.</p>
<p>Subject: Kirin</p>
<p>Flawed Design Model: Subject has not been exposed to any known significant religious instruction by parents. Accidental contamination possible through daily secular contact with other children or daycare staff. Subject has met all milestones of physical and mental development appropriate for her age. Subject demonstrates social behavior desired by her society such as kindness, empathy, cooperation and following rules. These behaviors confirmed by observation by grandparents without parents presence.</p>
<p>Provisional Conclusion: Preschool children develop appropriate social behaviors without early religious instruction.</p>

<p>Oh good the link works.</p>
<p>It perplexes me that this argument has existed since 270BCE, yet the delusion persists.</p>

<p>Dr. HARRIS: I think well, first of all, there is an amazing diversity of opinion of just how we should cash out our talk of right and wrong, and good and evil. And it&#8217;s quite remarkable how difficult it can be to get people to concede that human flourishing, and the flourishing of conscious creatures, generally is what we should what should concern us.</p>
<p>But the moment you admit that much, the moment you admit that a real conversation about morality relates to human well-being - to take our case specifically - then most of moral talk that defines our public policy immediately begins to fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>I mean, the Catholic Church is more concerned about preventing contraception than about preventing the rape of children. It&#8217;s more concerned about preventing gay marriage than genocide.</p>
<p>Now these this is if you&#8217;re concerned about human flourishing, this is clearly an inversion of priorities, to put it most charitably, and so the framework being offered here is not an alternate moral framework we have to take seriously.</p>
<p>This is a framework we can ignore in the same way we could ignore the Catholic Church if they were talking about physics and saying things like, well, we&#8217;re interested in the physics of the transubstantiation - or the physics that allows the Holy Ghost to be here and there and everywhere at once.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a physicist alive who would be forced to take those utterances seriously, and yet when we talk about morality, it seems that everyone&#8217;s opinion has to count equally. But everyone&#8217;s opinion is not actually constrained at this moment by an intelligent, or even intelligible, concern for human flourishing. And I think the moment we grant that human flourishing is the point, our moral discourse would change remarkably.</p>

<p>Jefferson, however, did not shrink from questioning the existence of God. In a 1787 letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr, while at school, Jefferson offered the following advice:</p>
<table class="cquote">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top">&ldquo;</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>Fix Reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve the homage of reason than of blindfolded fear. &#8230; Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it end in a belief that there is no God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise and in the love of others which it will procure for you. &#8212; (Jefferson&#8217;s Works, Vol. ii., p. 217)<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_and_religion#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
