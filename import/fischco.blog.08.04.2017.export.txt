BODY:
<p>We went to the Arizona Renaissance Festival this past weekend. It was a blast. The fair is 17 years old now, and they've really come a long way even since we started going about 6 years ago. </p><p></p><p><img width='110' height='83' border='0' hspace='5' align='left' src='http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/RenFair-9.serendipityThumb.jpg' alt='' />We met up with some of our friends from Tucson, who we knew from the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/az/arizonafencing/">Arizona Fencing Academy</a>, and toured around. They're pretty much ren fair fanatics, so they're also great shoppers. This was the first year angela and I actually had any money to speak of to spend here. It's a lot more fun when you don't have to count every coin you have left. </p><p></p><p>We did most of our wandering in the morning, the place opened at 10am. It's late March, and the weather in PHX is already starting to get up there. Fortunately it was overcast that day, so we weren't too bad. It still got up into the high 90s though. We saw a few shows, the two of special note were a musical act called '<a href="http://www.castinbronze.com/">Cast in Bronze</a>', and a comedy swordfight act called '<a href="http://www.donjuanandmiguel.com/">Don Juan &amp; Miguel</a>'. </p><p></p><p>The Cast in Bronze act was really interesting. This guy plays an instrument called a Carillion. I've never even heard of one of these things. It's a bunch of huge bronze bells rigged up to some levers and foot pedals, and you can play it using your hands and feet. Evidently these things are almost exclusively found in cathedrals and the like, since they don't lend themselves well to portability. This guy managed to get his hands on a portable one (relatively speaking), and he tours the country sharing his really interesting musical talent.</p><p></p><p>Then right after them were Don Juan &amp; Miguel. They're two 'Spanish Gentlemen' who tell lots of great jokes as they run around with swords and whips. You can see why angela and i like them. These guys are really hard to describe, you really should catch one of their shows.</p><p></p><p><a href='http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/RenFair-1.jpg'><img width='103' height='110' border='0' hspace='5' align='right' src='http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/RenFair-1.serendipityThumb.jpg' alt='' /></a>Then we did some more shopping. I got a hat, and angela got a parasol. She also got this cool gryphon puppet that sits on her shoulder. The puppet is a riot. The thing looks so real. There's a control wire that runs down its tail and across your back, you can make the puppet's head turn, and look up and down. Unless you are really close, it looks eerily real. She gets lots of stares, and a few people come up and have to ask her what it is.</p><p></p><p>Until next year! (angela wants a cape next year)</p>

<p>So I finally got around to playing with the website tonight.  I realized that what I really wanted was a simple place to put up notes, and to allow other people in the family to do the same.  So I have installed some new blogging software, and we'll see how that goes.  I have to create accounts by hand right now, so if you want an account and your own blog let me know!  I will start copying over my other entries from the old system tomorrow.</p>

BODY:
<p>Michele picked us up last night to take us to the bead club. The clouds were gray and low, the wind pushing leaves about lazily.  The monsoons are unpredictable. No guessing where or even if the storm would break. So we decided to cautiously venture out to the bead store. </p><p>We drove north up to Skyline looking for a sandwich shop on the way. As we went north, the rain began to splatter lightly and the wind picked up a little. A stoplight lost power just as we approached it on River road. Michele bravely and safely forged the intersection. The power loss was a bit surprising as I had not seen or heard any lightning or thunder in the area. </p><p>We continued on to Skyline where we pulled into a parking lot to feed the howling Kirin beast and consider our choice of eateries. The place we had hoped to visit was already closed for the evening. As I perched over the front seat to reach Kirin in her car seat the wind began to gust, the drizzle turned to a downpour. I turned to face forward as the wind rocked the car and the rain obscurred everything beyond the windows.  Michele looked rather pale and I imagine I did as well. We agreed to sit and wait out the storm. The car continued to rock, the wind howled and sheets of water beat on the windows creating a cacophony. I thought of calling Mark but I would have had to yell into the phone to be heard over the incredible noise. Then the rain abated just enough to see the trees immediately before us in the parking lot and just a glimpse of the road beyond some 30 or 40 feet.  The mesquite tree to our left uprooted and blew over onto the sidewalk with a small thud. A few cars were stopped in the roadway before us but I still could not see the far lane or the opposite side of the road. Kirin continued crying throughout this in fear lonliness or hunger or maybe all three. I climbed over the seat and unstrapped her from the car seat to hold her in my lap. We waited maybe another five minutes and the wind calmed to irregular gusts and the rain slackened to allow us to see across the parking lot.  Michele and I could now talk without shouting at one another. </p><p>She drove us cautiously to the grocery store on the other side of the lot. People were dashing in and out of the grocery so we hoped to find food and shelter inside. Michele darted out into the rain, grabed Kirin from my lap and ran under the building's overhanging patio. More ponderously and less gracefully I maneuvered out onto the wet pavement. Even with the cane to help, my boot slipped on the wet blacktop and I came within moments of falling onto the unforgiving asphalt. I caught myself just in time but sustaining a minor muscle pull in the right hip. Fortunately Michele did not see all this flailing about as she was occupied with getting Kirin to the patio. From the patio, Michele dashed and I hobbled to the entrance of the store. </p><p>To our surprise, the staff huddled in the entrance with several customers. The lights were out. The staff had flashlights. Managers were herding people out from the back of the store. They informed us they were closing up but we could wait in the entrance with them out of the rain as it wasn't safe to send any one out into the storm. Kirin sniffled in Michele's arms and then all the staff and customers admired the brave wet baby. </p><p>Wonder of all wonders the rain slowed to a drizzle and we could finally see all across the parking lot and into the roads. By now we were all soaking wet and shivering. We dashed ( I use the term loosely ) back to the car and turned on the heater. Cars were moving cautiously on the roadways through the blackened intersection. We agreed to try a few more miles in hopes of finding food power and shelter in the direction of the bead store. Michele drove most carefully with us. We stopped at Aj's on Campell and Skyline to attend to our creture comforts. </p><p>Michele had never been to Aj's so we had dinner and shopped. By the time we had enjoyed all the store had to offer the rain had stopped. The wind had settled to a gentle breeze. Rainbows arched across the sunset while the luminous silver, gray and multihued blues of the clouds hung over the Catalinas like a benediction from the Storm Gods. We drove home uneventfully with many good eats in our bags, full tummies, a sleeping baby and without any beads after Kiri's first monsoon adventure.</p>

<p>Well, Angela is doing really well.  She's feeling good enough to actually start going back to work in a limited fashion. Unfortunately, the original idea of bringing Kirin to work with her isn't really going to work they decided.  I had doubts about this idea, so it's not really surprising to me, but still it means we had to seriously start looking at daycare.</p><p>Daycare for a vulnerable little person who is not quite 4 months old scares the bejeezers out of the both of us.  You interview friends, find out who they trust, visit the place, see good things... but when you drop off your daughter with a relative stranger and have to walk away while she's screaming her head off... well its pretty much one of the hardest things I've had to do in my life.</p><p>I think I'm taking it slightly better than Angela, she had a real hard time going this morning, even though we were close to being late to her doc appointment.  Countless parents and children go through this routine ever day, and have for centuries.  Daycare is just a modern extension of 'the village'.  It doesn't make it any easier though, and you can't help but feel that you're being a bad parent.</p><p>We'll see how it goes.  The daycare people say today went better than yesterday, and we're taking her in for a short time tomorrow, even though we don't really have to.  Angela plans on working 3 days a week, and I'm going to try and stay home one of those days.  That limits our daycare to only two days a week for the most part, with the occasional 3rd day thrown in there I'm sure for emergencies.</p><p>Well, we'll keep you posted on how it works out!</p>

<p>I found this article today <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2005/06/microsoft_intel.html">I found this article today</a> and it made me laugh.  Most of you know I'm a pretty big mac head, so the whole <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html">announcement from apple that they will be moving to Intel CPUs</a> has me fairly interested.  All in all I think it can be a good thing or a bad thing.  I'm betting on the good thing because I'm an optimist.  Over the years apple has moved more and more towards standard components (SCSI drives to ATA, standard memory, USB, PCI, AGP, etc) so moving to a more standard processor architecture is sort of the next step.  I for one am hoping that it will be easier to develop drivers for video cards now than it has been in the past.  Nothing frustrated us mac heads more than having to wait 6 months to use a new video card because there were no drivers yet (of course in 6 months there was a NEW new video card...).</p><p></p><p>The whole virtualization thing will be interesting to watch also.  It has been widely quoted that <a href="http://news.com.com/Apple+throws+the+switch%2C+aligns+with+Intel+-+page+2/2100-7341_3-5733756-2.html?tag=st.next">Apple will not do anything to prevent people from running Windows</a> on an Apple made Intel machine.  Things like Virtual PC will also run much better.  So we may ned up seeing more people switch to Apple hardware for the added flexibility of running Windows/MacOS/Linux.  On the other hand, game developers may not feel the need to port games to the mac, they may tell people to go install Windows on your mac and run the games in Windows.</p><p></p><p>The reverse will also be true eventually.  People out there with more geek power than I will invariably figure out how to run MacOS on non-apple hardware. (dell, gateweay, etc)  Hopefully this will be difficult enough that only die-hard hardware people will even try, like soldering a mod-chip onto your motherboard.</p><p></p><p>We have a year to wait pretty much to see what will happen.  So in the mean time... back to work.</p>

<p>Last week we took Kirin with us to San Francisco.  It was her first plane trip.  She did amazingly well, considering we had 4 delayed airplanes. I was going to <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon 2007</a>, a conference for <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> programmers. Since the hotel was paid for, all we had to do is get Angela a ticket, and bring her and Kirin along for the ride.</p><p>The conference was pretty much a geek-fest.  Hundreds of programmers milling about, going to talks given by other programmers.  We learned lots, and somehow I managed to pass the <a href="http://www.zend.com/education/zend_php_certification">PHP certification test</a>.  Security was big, as was ajax/web2.0 stuff.  Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, and a bunch of other big names are now taking PHP pretty seriously, and were at the conference in force.</p><p>Anyhow, Angela managed to make it to downtown San Francisco one day with Kirin.  BART trips, trolleys, strollers, all by themselves!</p><p>Thursday my parents happened to be going through Oakland, so we managed to take the BART across the bay to meet them for dinner.  I'll have to bug Dad for the name of the restaurant where we ate.  It was a great oriental place, with awesome food.</p><p>We got back to Tucson late Saturday night, and Kirin is still recovering from here upset schedule.

<p>So I got another virus in my email again today.  Now since I'm a mac head, these usually don't cause me to raise an eyebrow at them, they just go into the trash.  However this one piqued my interest...</p><blockquote><p>Dear user estranged,</p><p></p><p>It has come to our attention that your Mac User Profile ( x ) records are out of date. For further details see the attached document.</p><p>  </p><p>Thank you for using Mac! </p><p>The Mac Support Team </p><p></p><p>+++ Attachment: No Virus (Clean)</p><p>+++ Mac Antivirus - www.mac.com</p><p>&lt;attached account-info.zip&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Now this has VIRUS written all over it!  .zip attachment, short obscure message about account info that came unsolicited etc.  However, since it was specifically targeting <a title="Mac Dot Com" target="_blank" href="http://www.mac.com">.Mac</a> users, I had to stop and scratch my head a second.  It is quite possible that someone actually DID write a MacOS X virus, and is trying to spread it.  So I took a chance and saved the .zip file to my drive, and unzipped it with the unzip shell command, so that Stuffit wouldn't try to auto-do-something with it.  Now for the truly interesting part.  It unzipped into:</p><blockquote><p>account-info.htm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .exe</p></blockquote><p>I love it!  Cute way to try and hide the fact that it's a .exe with all the spaces there, but c'mon!  It's still a Windows executable!  Mac users can't even get infected with this!  Why specifically target mac users with a windows virus?  I just can't understand this one at all.</p>

<p>Angela and Kirin enjoy a ride on the elephant!  We went to the fair yesterday.  It was windy, and we walked too much for Angela&#8217;s foot, but we had a mostly good time.  Kirin was pretty enthralled I think, not smiling much, but huge wide eyes taking it all in.</p>

<p>Kirin&#8217;s been interested in widgets lately. Knobs, handles, light switches etc. Instead of continually shooing her away from them, we figured we&#8217;d make some just for her.</p>

<p><a href="<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wowgoldprice.com"">http://www.wowgoldprice.com"</a> rel="nofollow">Wow gold</a> is shorted for world of warcraft gold; it is the currency we used in one of the most popular MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game), it is the most valuable form of currency in this game. We can earn wow gold through many ways, players can look through some websites like ours which specialized in sales <a href="<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wowgold-shopping.com"">http://www.wowgold-shopping.com"</a> rel="nofollow">wow gold</a> to buy some gold, or they can spend a lot of time to upgrade their hero or other roles they chooses in the game. I think the most effective ways to get this gold are hunting, questing and crafting.</p>

<p>We took a week off and headed down the mountain to Sedona. It's not very far, but we never spend that much time there. We own a timeshare so we swapped in for a week in Sedona. We did some hiking, some shopping, some eating, and a lot of relaxing.</p><p></p><p>We got in late saturday night, hit the grocery store for some basic supplies and went to bed. Sunday we drove out of town a short distance to the Devil's Bridge trail. It's a pretty short trail, but the last little bit is up these really steep stairs. The bridge itself is pretty cool, and the views were great.</p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_devilsbridge/DSCN0780.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_devilsbridge/DSCN0779.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_devilsbridge/DSCN0778.thumb.jpg"></p><p></p><p>Monday we found this little magic/kite shop. So we bought a kite. I've always liked flying kites, and it's been quite a while since i had flown one. We drove up Schnebly Hill road out of Sedona and got to a good spot to fly the kite. </p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_kite/DSCN0785.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_kite/DSCN0795.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_kite/DSCN0811.thumb.jpg"></p><p></p><p>We got in two good flights, the second one ended with the kite up a tree. So i had to climb up and get it down. Kite retrieved, it was getting dark and we headed back down to town.</p><p></p><p>On tuesday, Angela's parents drove up from phx and we took a jeep tour out to the Honanki Indian ruins. The road really sucks, and having a good 4 wheel drive jeep helped. The ruins are pretty amazing. It's hard to believe you can actually get this close to ruins anymore. Most of the good sites are either completely off limits, or you have to be so far away its almost not worth it.</p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_honanki/DSCN0814.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_honanki/DSCN0818.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_honanki/DSCN0829.thumb.jpg"></p><p></p><p>On thursday we did another short hike. Cathedral Rock is a little south of Sedona. It gets into real rock climbing about half way up. We didnt quite make it to the top since we had to be somewhere too soon.</p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_cathedral/DSCN0838.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_cathedral/DSCN0840.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_cathedral/DSCN0843.thumb.jpg"></p><p></p><p>Once we were done rock hopping, it was a dash back to the resort for Dream Catcher class!</p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_sedona/DSCN0784.thumb.jpg"></p><p></p><p>It turns out these aren't too hard to make. After one class i saw one of the three dimensional ones, and figured out how to make one of those. I'll have to take a picture of some of our completed ones.</p><p></p><p>Later in the day one of our friends came down from Flag and brought our dogs so we could go play in the river with them. </p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_sedona/DSCN0844.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_sedona/DSCN0845.thumb.jpg"></p><p></p><p>Friday my parents came up from Phx, and we went out to a really nice (expensive) dinner. Oh so much good food in this place.</p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_sedona/DSCN0846.thumb.jpg"></p><p></p><p>All in all we had a really great laid back time. Too short of course, neither of us is eager to return to work tomorrow. We'll be back I'm sure for more hiking and dining!</p><p></p><p>Complete <a href="/Gallery/mark_sedona">photo albums</a> are available!</p>

<p>Well, my countdown to 30 has reached one today.  Yesterday we went out to dinner and to see the new Harry Potter movie.  Today we need to figure out a way to hang up my new hammock.  Woo sounds like a trip to Home Depot to me!</p><p><b>Update:</b>4:30 pm:  It's Hammock Time!</p><p></p><p>So yesterday our friend Dana went out to dinner with Angela and I to <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/0516oreganos16.html">Oregano's</a>, a great little pizza joint here in Flagstaff.  They make some really great pizza, but the true draw for me is their one desert.  They make pizzookie.  It's a pizza - cookie!  Pizzookie!  It's a huge cookie backed in this pan, and then topped with ice cream and chocolate chips.  The contrast of cold and hot is really great, and it just tastes awesome.</p><p></p><p>Then it was off to the theater to stand in line to see the new <a href="http://www.harrypotter.com">Harry Potter</a> movie.  We got there over an hour before the movie started, and got a good place in line.  It's boring standing in line for an hour, but se stood around and talked about moving, jobs, and all that.  We managed to get really great seats for the movie, so the wait was worth it.  The movie was a blast just like the others.  Maybe I'm easy to please, but I really liked this movie despite a lot of people claiming the first two were better.  Who cares, this movie rocked without needing to compare it to the others.  The only big problem is that with the books getting substantially thicker than #1 and #2, they have to cut out more and more to get it to a decent length that kids can sit through.  They hit all the main points, but some of the details get lost.  I have no idea how they're going to manage to do the Goblet of Fire.</p><p></p><p>So Sunday morning, eating left over pizza, and getting ready to head out to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com">Home Depot</a> for bolts.  Woot.</p><p></p><p><b>Update:</b> 4:30 pm</p><p>We got the hammock hung up.  I was humbled because my complex engineering way of attaching the hammock failed miserably, and Angela's simple way works great.</p><p></p><p><img src="/albums/mark_backyard/DSC00006.highlight.jpg" border="1"></p>

BODY:
<p><a href="/Gallery/mark_fence">Full Photo Album for this project can be found here.</a></p><p>    <p>Our poor fence started falling down almost as soon as we moved in. Many of the posts had become rotted through at the base, and once the dogs started leaning on the fence, it's days were numbered. I figured early on that the solution was to simply replace the rotted out posts with metal poles. Simple right? Ha!</p><img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00006_1.thumb.jpg"></p><p>    <p>The posts were set in concrete. A lot of concrete. This normally wouldn't be so bad, except the soil in our area isn't so much dirt as it is a low grade concrete itself. It's primarily clay, with a ton of large and small rock in it. Concrete. My first attempt to remove one of the old footings resulted in a month and a half of banging on it with a pry bar and pick axe. You have to excavate a large space around the concrete before you can attempt to break up the footing and pull out the pieces. I started this about a year and a half ago, and after getting one out, decided I needed another aproach.</p><p>    <p>In the intervening time, Angela graduated from <a href="http://www.nau.edu/hp/pt">PT school</a>, and got a job. Now she's done with that one and we're pretty much set on moving. So now we MUST fix the fence. Somehow I managed to con.. convince yeah, convince my family into coming up to Flagstaff and helping. So my mom, dad, and one of my brothers came up and we went at it in ernest.</p><p>    <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00007_1.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00005_1.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00017.thumb.jpg"></p><p>    <p>This time I decided we needed some mechanical help. Enter the <a href="http://www.totalgrandrental.com/">jackhammer rental place</a>. for about $100 you get a 75 pound electric jackhammer for 24 hours. This thing was pretty nice. It's heavy as all hell, and schlepping it around was a pain. It just powered through the concrete (both the dirt and the footings). There were two sections of fence that needed replacing. We started in the back, where I had completed the first hole. We had 3 more to go back there, and we pretty much busted out the whole footings. Then we moved over to the side fence, and figured that we didn't really need to remove all of the old concrete, just enough to get the old hole clear so we could set the new poles in them. This turned out to be really nice, and a lot less work.</p><p>    <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00008_001.thumb.jpg"></p><p>    <p>Busting out the old concrete was really the hardest part of this whole project. Once that was done, we got some cardboard forms and fit them to the holes. Mixed up some new concrete, and poured it in around new poles.</p><p>    <p>After two days, we had excavated all the holes and managed to pour one new pole. My family had to leave, so Angela and I were left with pouring the remaining 6 new poles. We did manage to get 4 of them done in the intervening week, and my family came up again the following weekend to help us finish it all up.</p><p>    <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00001.thumb.jpg"></p><p>    <p>After getting all the poles in, we began to hang up the old fence pannels. Fortunately, the pannels are in pretty good shape, so we could re-use them. After a bit of running around to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com">Home Depot</a>, we finally get all the various parts we need to attach the fence pannels to the new poles and begin hanging pannels.</p><p>    <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00006.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00002.thumb.jpg"> <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00016.thumb.jpg"></a></p><p>    <p>With the pannels all hung, we bid fairwell to my family again. Angela's parents come up the following day, and we manage to get almost all the remaining slats put into the fence.</p><p>    <img src="/albums/mark_fence/DSC00008.thumb.jpg"></p><p>    <p>At the end of two full weekends, we now have a nice sturdy fence again, with only a few remaining slats to go in. Those require some trimming since somehow the spaces aren't quite the right size for any even number set of slats to fit in... oh well.</p><p>    <p>Next in the What We Had To Do To Sell Our House Saga? Will it be power washing the outside of the house? Painting the inside? Replacing the carpet? Tune in next week!</p>

<p>Well it's official, we're out of Flagstaff <img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/sad.png" alt=":-(" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" /></p><p></p><p>Angela and I got tired of her driving back and forth to Camp Verde all week.  So she quit there and the search began for a new job.  Near this time my good friend from <a href="http://www.arizona.edu">U of A</a> and I got to talking about coming to work for her there.  Things worked out better than I could have imagined, and so we're heading down to Tucson.  Angela's been there for three weeks working already, and she really likes her job.</p><p></p><p>My last day at <a href="http://www.nau.edu/hp/">NAU</a> was Wednesday which was sad.  They threw me a great party on Monday though, and it was a blast.  This was my first job where I got a going away party, so I must have done some good work for them.</p><p></p><p>I've spent the last few days working on the house.  We need to sell the house, and that's sort of the last thing we need to do with Flagstaff.  Both my family and Angela's have been up over the past few weeks to help get the house in order.  The inside of the house is almost finished being painted, the cracks are patched, the stains are painted, and darnit if the house doesn't look pretty good!</p><p></p><p>Anyhow, I'm heading down to Tucson Saturday morning.  My new job working for the U of A's new <a href="http://www.oscr.arizona.edu/">Office of Student Computing Resources</a> starts monday.  I've already got my first meeting lined up.  I'll be helping to manage some of their <a href="http://oscr.arizona.edu/multimedia">multimedia labs</a>.  It will be a blast I think, I used to work in <a href="http://mll.arizona.edu">one of these labs</a> eight years ago as a student worker, so I've got the whole full circle thing going for me.</p><p></p><p>New things, new times.  I'm sure we'll all do well!</p>

<p>We're in Italy!  Tuesday and Wednesday were spent on planes.  It's about 3 hours from Phoenix to Atlanta, about 7 hours from Atlanta to Paris, and then about 2 hours from Paris to Pisa.  Ann and Mark managed to get some of their luggage lost, but there's some hope that it will show up today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apartments we have are really nice.  It's about 20 minutes northwest of Pisa in a the small village of Migliarino.  They sub-devided an old farmhouse into about 6 separate apartments.  We have the largest one I think, with 3 rooms, sleeping 8 total.  We have a full kitchen which David has put to good use so far, cooking pasta (go figure) and some great stew.  We have an oven, so pizza is coming I'm sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday we had our orientation with the rest of the Untours people.  We had our first taste of driving unescorted around the Italian countryside.  Mostly you just have to be pushy otherwise you'll never get anywhere.  We drove about 25 minutes from Migliarino where we're staying, east through Santa Maria del Guidice to a little restaurant where we had our orientation.  Everyone else in the group seems to be from the US.  About half of us are in Migliarino, and the other have are in Calci, just northeast of Pisa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/P1010019.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/P1010019.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>We managed to find a grocery store where we stocked up on some food.  Angela is still having stomach troubles so we were happy to find somewhere we could get her some food since most of what we brought is in our lost piece of luggage.  After lunch we had an exploratory trip into Pisa to check out an internet cafe and try and get online.  Bad luck is they didn't have a wireless setup, and we couldn't figure out how to get Mark's laptop registered with their DHCP server, so no luck getting the TiBook online.  Fortunately, I did remember to bring my USB stick so we can copy photos and such onto their computers for posting.  I hope to do some research while I'm here and see about free/pay wireless hotspots around town.  If anyone comes up with any info let Mark know (estranged@mac.com).  It would be awesome if we could find something in or around Migliarino, since getting in and out of Pisa is a bit of a chore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0140.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0140.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>I know everyone is dying to know so... yes, it leans.  Today we have the tower tour planned, along with the rest of the buildings.  More walking about Pisa, then back to the farmhouse for wine and cheese.  Oh things are rough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More to come!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric!  Go check your email!!</p>

<p>Friday - Pisa</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0208.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0208.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="left" /></a>We went back to Pisa on Friday for most of the day.  I was surprised, but they actually let you climb up the tower.  There are a lot of steps.  The steps are all very well worn, as you'd expect from centuries of feet climbing up them.  Climbing the tower is very odd.  It is a large spiral staircase that leads up to the 7th floor.  Here they number all their floor starting with the ground floor, or 0, then 1st floor etc, so 1st floor is not the ground floor.  0 based indexing!  As you climb however, you move around the tower, and the slant of the tower is very apparent.  Sometimes you're leaning against the outside wall, sometimes the inside wall.  Sometimes you feel like you're falling down the stairs, othertimes the stairs are really really steep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0197.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0197.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0210.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0210.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>From the 7th and 8th floors you get a really great view of the city.  On the 7th floor are the bells.  Nothing would prevent you from reaching out and touching them except for a 'Don't touch the bells' sign.  Tourists in Italy must be more courteous I guess, something like that in the states would surely have been ruined by centuries of reach out and touch, maybe I could break of a piece and bring it home with me attitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0226.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0226.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>After the tower we went into the cathedral.  They really know how to build churches in italy.  There is detail everywhere. The little wells for the holy water are huge fountains topped with bronze sculptures.  The pulpit is a massive 8 foot wide circular sculpture.  The walls are covered with oil paintings depicting all manner of biblical scenes.  The columns are all inlaid with cut stone, everything is just so detailed.  I completely understand why it took them two hundred years to build this place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturday - Firenze (Florence)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0260.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0260.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>Saturday we got up way way too early so we could drive to Florence and meet Debbie and Michael for breakfast.  Florence is a much larger city than Pisa, and was absolutely not designed for automobile traffic.  We drove around in circles for about half an hour before finding the car park below the train station.  The city is so interesting to just walk around in.  There probably are buildings built in the last 50 years or so, but we didn't see any of them.  The whole city is sort of layered.  The ground floors of all the buildings are shops.  Coat shops, leather shops, shops that sell nothing but leather shoes.  Pastry shops, butcher shops, tabacci shops, gelato shops.  Everything you would need for daily living could be found walking up and down both sides of a single block in most places.  The second floors seem to be offices.  I'm mostly guessing at this but I did see someone coming down the stairs of one building with a briefcase... so I made a wild guess!  The upper floors are where everyone lives.  This is where we met up with Debbie and Michael.  They were staying in a small bed &amp; breakfast right in the middle of Florence.</p>

<p>About a block away from the B&amp;B we found the Piazza della Signoria, where there is a great open air gallery of sculpture, and the Uffizi Museum. Unfortunately they won't let you take pictures inside the museum, so until I get some of our postcards scanned, no pictures of the insides.  The Uffizi has a lot of stuff in it.  Apparently at some point in the past, one of the rulers of Italy decided that the churches were bad, and had all the artwork from many hurches rounded up.  Fortunately he didn't destroy them, and after a while someone found it all and sent it to the Uffizi since they didn't know where it had come from originally.  There are several rooms filled just with these religious works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0277.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0277.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>The one piece of art I really wanted to sneak a picture of was 'the birth of Venus' by Sandro Bottichelli.  She's the one who was the icon for adobe Illustrator until CS.  Most of the women in the paintings seem to be naked, and everyone is naked in the sculptures.  There's simply too many things in the Uffizi to describe, so go read about it if you want to know more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0295.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0295.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="left" /></a>After that, it was time for lunch.  Angela and I were feeling pretty rotten at this point, having both caught Marty's cold.  We had soup.  Marty was feeling better however, and she had pizza.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it was on to the science museum, Museo di Storia della Scienza.  Here was a wonderful collection detailing the birth of science as we know it today.  There were navigational instruments from simple sundials to artfully wrought astrolabes.  One of the things that struck me was the level of skill involved in those who made these tools, since each one was hand made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0299.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0299.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="74" align="left" /></a>The highlight for me were Galileo's rooms.  Anyone who's taken physics will remember the incline plane experiment where he calculated the acceleration due to gravity.  Well here was his original incline plane, complete with little position-able bells that ring when the ball passes under them.  In the next room were his telescopes.  He made several in his time, and in this museum are the first telescopes he made with which he observed the features of the moon, the planets, and got himself branded as a heretic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sunday, we drove around Lucca and up to Villa Reale. This is one of the many Villas around Lucca that date from the 15th century and later. They reached their peak following Napolean's conquest of the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/P1010032.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/P1010032.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>Villa Reale has several houses, a meandering brook and a lake at the lower end. It covers several hundred acres, with numerous formal gardens. The prettiest was the gardenio del Limones, with a swan in the reflecting pool at the upper end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wierd one was the gardenia del teatro. A juniper garden trimmed to look like a theater. It was complete with a stage, footlights and the prompters box. The junnipers were trimmed to include the audience seating space and balcony. Behind was the actors' green room and stage access for the wings. Complete pictures will follow.</p>

We wandered through the town, across the old bridge, and down to the Church of San Francesca. The church is on the Plaza Mazzini, and contains the oldest know portrait of Saint Francis, dating from 1235.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/Pescia06.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/Pescia06.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="left" /></a>We crossed the Pescia river again across a modern footbridge (1950's?) and photographed the old bridge and clock tower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We drove back to Pisa, and partied with the other Untour winos in the apartment nect to ours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuesday (10/11) we drove east of Pisa to the small village of Zambra. Here we were treated to the eccentric collections of a gentleman of the village. His specialties are old tools and utensils, some dating from over a hundred years ago. Many machines, including metal bending and forming mills, electrical voltmeters and ampmeters, and farm implements. Ancient sycles and two handed scythes, wood yoked wood and metal plows, and tractors and steam powered thrashing machines from the 1920's and 1930's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside we found a wonderful collection of watches and clocks to thrill Eric's heart. The piece de resistance was a framed, glassed collection of pocket watches that are all in working order. His wife described thems as "tutto 'tick-tick-tick'" and "oro y argento". The all ticked, and were cased by gold and silver. They were magnificent. "Bellissimo".</p>

<p>Wednesday (12 Oct)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaWalls01.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaWalls01.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>Today was Lucca. This city dates from the Etruscan period (1000 BC - 250 BC), hence the name of the region, Tuscany in English, or Toscana in Italian. The Romans conquered the region in 200 BC. The Forum and Amphitheater can still be found, although buried by current buildings (which date from 1000 AD).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0404.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0404.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="right" /></a>The first Roman walls and gates were enhanced and enlarged during the middle ages. We have a couple photographs of one of the mediaeval gates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern city is surrounded by one of the best defensive fortifications found in Italy. They date from 1600 - 1700 AD. The city was conquered by Napoleon, who gave the city to his sister. She turned the fortification walls into a park, circumnavigating the entire wall. You can bicycle around the entire wall. Or you can walk, which we found to be a favorite activity of the lucchese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaCity01.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaCity01.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>We entered Lucca through the walking gate at Baluardo Santa Maria. Then up past the Piazza Napoleone to the Piazza San Michelle and the Romanesque church. Then on to Via Roma. From there we walked down to the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition of working models based on his multitudinous drawings. Eric would have a field day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaCity04.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaCity04.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="right" /></a>At this point we walked down Via Santa Croce, past wonderful (and expensive) small shops. We stopped for lunch at Trattoria le Collona. Two vegetable plates and two panini were 9 euros (about 11 dollars). A great price for Italy and a tourist. And they were served hot, out front on the piazza (see photo).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaWalls12.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaWalls12.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a>Following lunch, we walked out onto the Baluardo San Regolo. We took in the fortifications, their invincibility for the Renaissance period, and marveled at the work and treasure required for their completion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaWalls07.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/LuccaWalls07.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="right" /></a>Then we walked down to the Orto Botaninco. The fee was three euros, not too bad for the botanical gardens themselves, but the bonus was an exhibit housed in the underground tunnels under the Baluardo. Here was a history of the city and it's fortifications, prepared for the visit of a delegation from China. It was stunning. We have photographs from the tunnels, rooms and barracks within the Baluardo. We can see the firing slits, cannon powder rooms and billets for the soldiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the botanical gardens were no slouch, either. We saw a Cedar of Lebanon, planted in 1830, and a multitude of similarly ancient plantings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then hiked up to the Piazza San Francesca, where we succumbed to gellato. This is the smoothest, creamiest ice cream made, when well done. And my cardiologist will not take kindly to my consumption of this confection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/VillaGuinigi01.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/VillaGuinigi01.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="left" /></a>Following this treat, Mark and Angela went off to climb the Torre Guinigi (then tower of the Guinigi family) and get great pictures. Marty, Carl, Ann and I went off to the Villa Guinigi. This is currently undergoing an extensive rennovation, and being October, late for the tourista season, we were the only people in the building. It is a museum, and the works date from early Etruscan funereal works through the Roman period with tiles and frescos, up to Tuscan paintings from the 1100 - 1750 AD period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I received a cell phone call from Angela, saying they had found the Internet Point store and were plugged in. They had begun to download the updates to fischco.org for Monday and Tuesday. We then set out to find the Via Anfiteatro, and the address of what might be our evening dinner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We walked along to the Piazza San Pietro Somaldi, and thence to Via Anfiteatro and the site of the Roman Amphitheater. What is left is a ring of buildings on the foundation of the amphitheater, and the center is a plaza with shops around the rim. We left Carl and Ann to sit in the sun while we went off to find Mark and Angela (and a much needed WC). We did find them, and they were setting up to play Warcraft across the wide wide ether. The friendlies online at the time were from the US (7 AM), Australia (1 AM) and of course, Lucca (5 PM). A good time was had by all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We returned to the Amfiteatro, uncorked a bottle of wine and consumed some bruscetta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we walked back down the Via Fillungo, a great shopping street, purchased two wonderful pieces of Tuscan cheese (one soft and one hard...and both smelling superb). Thence to the gate at Porto San Pietro, and left Lucca behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We returned to our apartment in Migliarino and dined on cheese and bread with red wine, cold roast turkey breast and fresh bread, and bruschetta con pomadorro, mozzarella e oregano. White wine was served, and dark chocalate was consumed with relish. David collected 25 euro per person for the dinner (yeah, right).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone went to bed content.</p>

<p>Thursday (10/13). After a drive down the western coast of Italy past Livorno and admiring the steep cliffs to the ocean, Carl, Ann, Marty and Dave turned inland and headed for Volterra. This is an ancient city in a land of ancient cities. It was a center of the Etruscan world, and evideence of occupancy date back to the second and third millenia BC. By 800 BC, Volterra was a thriving community, and as late as 200 BC, held a treaty with Rome, supplying the Roman Legions during the Second Punic War with wheat for the soldiers and timber for the fleet. By this time, all the other Etruscan towns to the south had fallen under Roman dominion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0450.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0450.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" /></a><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0462.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0462.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" /></a><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0467.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0467.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spent time seeing the world's most extensive collection of Etruscan burial urns, eating gelato and strolling around the town. One can look out and down for tens of miles in all directions, and see clearly the importance of the location. The Medicis' understood this, and took the opportunity in 1474 to seize the town during a series of bloody disputes among the Volterran nobles. They then built a fortress that dominates the city to this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0476.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0476.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" /></a><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0481.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0481.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" /></a><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0487.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0487.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following this, we wandered to the east and the town of San Gimignano. This is the most visited (touristas) town in Italy, adn we were fortunated that it is October and the season for tours is long gone. We heard that in summer it is wall to wall people and 90 degrees. Again, we wandered through the town, admiring the fourteen remaining Medieval and Rennaisance towers. There were 72 at one point. There are wonderful shops, rivaling those of Paris and Rome, though not o many. One can easily spend a small fortune here. One can easily spend a large fortune here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it was the long trek back to Pisa.</p>

<p>Friday (10/14). The return to Firenza.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we arranged for tickets to see Michaelangelo's "David", usually considered the world's most beautiful sculpture. We took the Autostrada to Florence. It is necessary to stay in the right lane, as the left is for the "fast" cars. You pass on the left and dive back into the right lane only after carefully looking at least two kilometers behind you. I was comfortable at 120 kph (75 mph), but was frequently passed by folks doing perhaps 160-180. I felt I was standing still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDome01.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDome01.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDomeTools01.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDomeTools01.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="left" /></a>We arrived safely (to which this post attests), and parked in the underground lot at the train station. We checked in at the Galleria Dell' Acadameia, and then turned south toward the Duomo and dome of Brunlleschi. Mark, Angela, Marty and Dave climbed all 463 steps the the top of the dome, and we have the photographs to prove it. It is absolutely marvelous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDome06.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDome06.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDome07.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/TheDome07.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a></p>
<p>Following lunch, we meandered back to the Acadameia and got in line. Our line was for "prenotati". The really long line stretching around the building was for "non prenotati". There is a distinct advantage to having reservations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Acadameia has a long history. Before it became the arts teaching institute, it was a hospital. In 1877, it was decided to move the "David" inside to protect it from the weather. And this is where it resides to this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a phenominal work. It is 13 feet tall, and the block of marble was abandoned in despair by two previous sculpters before Michaelangelo cut away everything that did not look like David.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0572.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0572.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="left" /></a>We wandered back down to the Arno, and walked across the Ponte Vecchio. Another place to spend a fortune. This timne in gold. The Medici established to goldsmiths on the bridge as a way of cleaning up the riff raff that had occupied the bridge before. They gnomes with the gold have lived there ever since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evening settled in, we recrossed on a bridge to the west, and walked up through Gucci Gulch. Armani and all the rest were represented, and another fortune was contemplated therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We arrive back at the apartment in Migliarino late. And slept well.</p>

<p>Saturday (10/15) Greve</p>
<p>Today we left late. Sleep is good.  Another fast trip up the Autostrada, around Florence to the south, and down route 222 to Greve. Deep in Chianti country, Greve has a wine museum and a tasting room.  The museum has tools, books, bottles and other paraphernalia dating back to the late 1800s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0615.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0615.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="150" height="113" align="left" /></a></p>
<p>The wine tasting involves buying a mag-stripe card and walking around to the six kiosks. You insert your card and press the button on the wine you wish to sample. It is dispensed, and the cost is deducted from your card.</p>
<p>The latest edition was the 2000 Banfi, accompanied by the 1997, 1995 and 1993. These four tastings wiped 2/3 of our card. Oh, well, it was worth it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0633.jpg"><img src="http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/IMG_0633.serendipityThumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="5" width="113" height="150" align="right" /></a>In the process, we picked up a bottle of Marchese Antinori Chianti Classico 2000. It was 30% less than in the states, and a great value. We will leave it as a gift for the owner of our apartment, as she done a wonderful job for her clientele.</p>

<p>After naps, some wine and cheese by the fire (Angela found a wheelbarrow, and we have enough wood for the next week), Carl, Ann, Marty and Dave went out for dinner. 7:30 PM is early. The restaurant had just opened, and we were first in the door. Not for long. It filled up nicely.</p>
<p>The first course was two orders of mixed antipasto meats and two orders of mixed seafood. We ended up with 10 or 12 small dishes with two pieces on each platter. Some shrimps in a sauce, some squid strips in a salad, some beans, some boar, some ...well it was really neat. Lastly, Marty had a pasta and Porcini mushroom dish, and the rest of us had a mixed seafood grill. All very nice.</p>

<p>The late night phone call in Pisa, Italy was our son, Eric, informing us that the countertop people had called. We were excited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Well, the bad news is that the manufacturer made a mistake with your batch, which we rejected. Instead of the middle of October, it will be the middle of November."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were not excited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. Marty has been mumbling something about the countertop material she had selected looking a lot like the linoleum floor in the halls of Carl Hayden High School where she teaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we arrived back in Phoenix, collected samples and selected a new style and color. Mike Holt, our countertop guy, informed us that this was the up and coming most popular style and DuPont was raising the price by 20 bucks a square foot. We had 80 square feet on order. But not until January, he added. So we signed. Installation was this past Friday.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I was reading about home automation, and I've been hung up on it ever since.  You know that stuff that lets you turn on and off lights, adjust  your AC, and water your lawns automatically.  Ok well the lawn part is silly for us in Tucson, but the rest of it still interested me.  The basics of this, X10, have been around for years.  I remember when I was a kid looking at the Tandy X10 stuff in Radio Shack.  I always wondered why everyone didn't have this stuff in all their houses.  Well after reading more about it, it turns out that the X10 protocol just isn't that reliable.  </p><p></p><p>Well times and technologies change.  About two years ago, a company called SmartHome that was already into making X10 devices decided to come up with a new protocol, <a href="http://www.insteon.net/">Insteon</a>.  (Take a read through <a href="http://www.insteon.net/specs.html">some of the specs</a> for it, its pretty fascinating how it works.) Their main claim was reliability.  After another few months recently of reading about it, I decided to take the plunge and see if this whole thing was worth it.</p><p></p><p>So far, it is way cool.</p><p></p><p>For my birthday, Angela, my parents and Angela's parents got me the basics I needed to setup an Insteon network.  Of course first I needed something to control, so we got 1 <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=94">lightswitch</a>.  Next I needed 2 units to bridge the two legs of the house power lines.  Evidently most houses have 2 separate 110 lines, and for commands to get from one leg to the other, you need a pair of <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=91">RF SignalLinc</a> units.  We also needed a unit that would let the computer plug into the powerline network so we got one <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=98">PowerLinc Controller</a>.  Lastly we needed some software to run on a Mac that would know how to deal with this whole mess, so I got a copy of <a href="http://www.perceptiveautomation.com/indigo/">Indigo</a> from Perceptive Automation.</p><p></p><p>After plugging in the plug-in stuff, and shutting off the power and re-wiring the switch, I was ready to go.  To my amazement, it worked!  I could now sit at my computer and turn my living room lights on and off!  Once the awe wore off, Angela and I began brainstorming about what we could actually use this for.  First we came up with a simple script to run at night.  The light switch has never been near the bed, so I wrote a little script in Indigo that dimmed the lights to about 60%, then after 2 minutes dimmed them to 25%, then after another 2 minutes turned them off.  This gave us enough time to get settled and into bed and the lights just turn themselves off after a bit.  We liked.  </p><p></p><p>Since Indigo runs on a Mac, and supports <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/">AppleScript</a>, we figured it could control <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a> too, and get some music into the mix.  So next I wrote a little wake-up script for Indigo.  At a preset time, the script fires and turns on iTunes at a fairly low volume level.  It also turns on the lights dimly at about 20%.  Over the next 5 minutes the lights gradually get brighter, and the music gradually gets louder.  All in all its a bit too effective at waking us up, which is the point I suppose.  It sure beats a blaring alarm clock buzzer.</p><p></p><p>After fiddling with this network and my 1 switch for two weeks, we decided that it worked well enough to get a few more controllable switches.  So we bought a <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=106">relay switch</a> to control our ceiling fans (can't use dimmer switches for fans).  We got a <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=101">simple dimmer switch</a> to control the lights outside the garage, and a <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=108">basic appliance switch</a>.  Lastly we got a fairly complex <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=97">8-button KeypadLinc</a>.  All the new switches wired in easily, and the computer recognized them right away and all was well.  </p><p></p><p>We put the appliance module on a large box fan that we use during the summer to help move the air around. With the new switch on the ceiling fans, we can now turn the fans off at about 1am when it gets a little cold to have them blowing, and back on at 9am when the good old Tucson heat begins to crank it up.  </p><p></p><p>The most interesting switch is the KeypadLinc.  With 1 button dedicated to turning on and off the kitchen lights, we have 7 buttons available to do pretty much whatever else we can think of.  One of the neat things about most Inseton devices is that you can cross-link them to control each other.  So I cross-linked button 2 on the keypad to the living-room lights, and button 3 to the ceiling fans.  This lets you turn the fans and lights on and off from either their real switches by the front door, or from the keypad in the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Anytime you click a button on any Insteon switch, it broadcasts that action to the network, and Indigo running on the Mac picks that up.  This gives you pretty much unlimited flexibility to do whatever you dream up.  First off I configured Indigo to fire off the 'night-time fade the lights off' script whenever button 8 was pressed.  Indigo knows what time it is, and also what time sunrise and sunset are, so the outside garage lights now come on at night and turn off in the morning.</p><p></p><p>We have a pretty small house, and there aren't many more switches I can think of that I'd want to replace.  Maybe a switch for the hallway lights, or a bathroom switch.  At some point I hope they come up with an Insteon version of some of the older <a href="http://www.smarthome.com/3045B.html">thermostats</a> and <a href="http://www.funforgeeks.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=37">temperature sensors</a> so the computer can look at the current temperature, get a forecast from the NOAA website, and then set the thermostat more appropriately.  The Insteon stuff is all still fairly new, so we're waiting for irrigation controllers, HVAC, motion detectors, remotes etc that are all available for X10.</p><p></p><p>So this has been really cool, and now we're settling into our more automated house.  As time goes on we'll probably think up more things to do with what we have, and perhaps add a few more controllable devices.  It's definitely good stuff!</p>

There are a ton of birds there, and about two thousand sea lions year round.

<p>We're in week 11 now.  We had the second checkup appointment today. We got to hear a heartbeat with a sound-o-scope thing the doc had, it was pretty cool!  The baby's heartbeat is about twice as fast as normal at this stage, growing like a crazy thing.  Everything seems to be progressing well, altho Angela has been pretty tired the past few weeks.  Everyone we've talked to said that's pretty normal, most of them spent the first trimester nauseous and in bed.  The second trimester is coming up though and most people say she should start to feel better soon.</p><p></p><p>No new pictures this time, but at 20-22 weeks we should be able to get a better ultrasound, and find out the gender!</p>

<p>Just in case having our first child wasn't enough excitement for us, we've decided to move as well!  We've spent 2 years in this house, and while we love the house itself, the location and yard (or lack thereof) has always been a sore spot with us.  Our poor dogs are really unhappy with the yard, and we finally got fed up with the neighbors.  So we're moving.</p><p></p><p>We found a nice 50s style house a bit farther east of where we live now, but still in town.  Its still really close to where Angela is working (she's changing jobs again too, even more excitement), and I'm only a tiny bit farther away from the university.  The house was newly remodeled, and has a brand new kitchen.  There are new floors, tile in the whole house except for the bedrooms.</p><p></p><p>In the grad tradition of my geek-dom, I have created a 3D model of the house, mostly to learn <a href="http://sketchup.google.com">SketchUp</a>, but also to serve as a good floor-plan for home automation stuff, and to show to people who ask 'so what's it look like?'.</p><p></p><p> <a href='http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/eli-house2.jpg'><img width='150' height='58' border='0' hspace='5' src='http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/eli-house2.serendipityThumb.jpg' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/eli-house.jpg'><img width='150' height='78' border='0' hspace='5' src='http://www.fischco.org/blog/uploads/mark/eli-house.serendipityThumb.jpg' alt='' /></a></p><p>We need some electrical work done to get our 220v dryer hooked up, and maybe to get some of the home automation stuff working.  We're also going to get new windows, currently there are good old single pane glass windows.  They're not exactly the most efficient windows, nor the safest.</p><p></p><p>Things are moving pretty fast on the house, we're set to sign loan documents next week, and close a little after that.  We should be all settled in before Halloween!</p>

It certainly is less back-breaking to re-arange the furniture on the computer instead of real life.</p>

<p>Much has been said on the different models for the various online music stores.  Here is my personal take.</p><p></p><p>Music and video are two very different mediums.  Music occupies one sense: sound.  Perhaps you could say it occupies touch also if you turn the music up loud enough, but sound is the primary sense.  Video occupies two senses: sight and sound.  As a result, there are certain activities where you can listen to music, or watch video at the same time, activities that occupy different senses.</p><p></p><p>Lets take music first.  Since it occupies only one sense, sound, we are free to use our other senses for other activities.  We can look at things.  We can move around.  We can't really listen to music and talk on the phone however, those activities overlap senses.</p><p></p><p>Video is more complex.  It occupies two senses, sight and sound.  We can't really look around too much, or we miss the video.  Moving around is also awkward since we must split our attention between the video and not bumping into things.  Running on a treadmil is ok, since we're not really in danger of running into things.</p><p></p><p>If we look at the activities when one listens to music, we find that in the majority of them, the music is secondary in nature.  Riding a bicycle, or driving an automobile; music is there, but it is a background activity.  Our primary focus is on a different task.  Video on the other hand is usually the primary task.  We sit down to watch television, we go to a theater to watch movies.  We generally don't do much else while watching the video.  Perhaps we eat or drink, but these are momentary, fleeting activities, and still secondary in nature.  Exercise might be one of the few activities that could be considered primary while watching video might be secondary.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of consumption of these two media types takes different forms.  Most music, with the exception of classical, tends to be fairly short.  Even classical compositions rarely reach the length of a television show or movie.  These smaller chunks are more easily consumed, and on a more frequent basis.  We can listen to the same song three to five times a week, and not think much of it.  Most of us probably enjoy it.  However we probably will not watch the same movie that often, much less a television episode, or even a music video.</p><p></p><p>Since the associated activities, and consumption frequency of these two media types are so different, might our ownership and sales models also be different?  Consider the successful <a href="http://www.itunes.com" target="_new">iTunes <s>Music</s> Store</a>.  Their model for media sales is ownership.  We pay Apple a one time fixed cost, and the media is given to us and we own it. (Well we own a license to use the media, but it's a very long term license)  We can listen to a song as many times as we want, and we never have to give Apple another cent.  Now consider other online media stores.  <a href="http://www.napster.com/" target="_new">Napster</a>, <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/" target="_new">Rhapsody</a>, and others heavily favor a subscription model.  We pay them a monthly fee, and can listen to as much music as we want each month.  If we stop paying, we can no longer listen to any of their music.</p><p></p><p>Now for me.</p><p></p><p>I like owning music.  It takes a lot for me to add a new song or new artist to my library.  I listen to my music a lot.  At home playing games, on my bicycle, in my car, at work, etc.  I probably loop through my music library once ever week and a half or so.  The songs that are in my main playlist however I really like, and I want to have them come up in rotation every few days.</p><p></p><p>Video is another matter.  I perhaps own 20-30 movies on DVD.  The last time I watched one of them was 2 months ago (<a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/MOV/002/index.html" target="_new">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn</a>).  I watch a fair amount of television.  I got really into <a href="http://www.farscape.com/" target="_new">Farscape</a> and Angel, and bought a few seasons of them on DVD.  I watched each episode once and haven't played them again.  I'm currently recording the new episodes of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/" target="_new">Battlestar Galactica</a>.  Since I'm not usually at home in front of my television Friday nights at 10pm, I record the episodes on <a href="http://www.tivo.com/" target="_new">TiVo</a>, and watch them when I get time.  Then I delete them.  I enjoy the story, but I don't think I'll ever be really dying to go back and watch them again.  Before I got a TiVo, I did buy a few episodes of Battlestar Galactica off iTunes.  Again I watched them once and haven't looked at them since.</p><p></p><p>I want to buy music.  I want to rent video.  They are different media, offer different experiences, last different lengths of time, and occupy different parts of my senses.  Why should we think they should be treated the same?</p>

<p>We got a new sonogramothing of our daughter a few weeks ago.  I uploaded it to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/" >Flickr</a> account a little while ago, and that got me thinking.  With all the privacy concerns these days, I'm not sure how publc I want pictures of my children to be.  Its one thing for parents to embarras their kids in front of their family (and likely their friends), but I think its another thing to embarras them in front of the world.</p><p></p><p>So I'm only going to post most pictures privately to my flickr account.  Unfortunately that means that people will have to create a Flickr account, ask me to add them to my family and friends list, and then they can login and see the images.  I know its a lot of hoops to jump through, but I think its probably best.</p><p></p><p>I'm not sure the steps to asking me for a friends invite... if you send me an email requesting it I can send you the instructions from inside Flickr I think, or post a comment here.</p>

<p>So this is my new journal site. All finished with the pregnancy site. 9 months of that was long enough. Time to move on. I'll try not to bore you with the daily trivia and stick to the interesting things.</p><p>Kirin's umbilical cord fell off today. She is officially hatched! She is growing, and eating (!), well. Her 2 week check up is tomorrow. Should have new numbers on her weight. She and Mark will probably go by themselves to the doctor. It's such a hassle to get me out and about. My leg and boot dont quite fit in the little saturn yet. Michele took me to the surgeon yesterday in her car. its a little easier. Heh, we got stuck in the elevator at the dr's office. Im sucha bad penny. At least they got us out quick. Then we went to my office and saw all my co-workers and had some fun with them. Sucha long day makes the foot ache pretty good but it was nice to be out and about a little.</p>

<p>Good news and bad news about the ankle.</p><p>Good News! The pins and bones and things are all well placed and the xrays look fine. The inside of my ankle looks like construction scaffolding, but it will do for a while. I am allowed to wash the whole thing now. So I washed it in freezing water yesterday! Oh that felt GOOD! Got it nice and NUMB! I am also allowed to do simple exercises with it 3 times a day. The doc says he is only permiting me to do some of these things because I AM a therapist. He wouldnt trust a regular patient to do the exercises by themselves at this point.</p><p>Bad news  : (<br/>The bone in my ankle is osteoporotic. I'll probably need a bone scan this year to check out the rest of my bones. What this means now, is that the bone will heal very slowly. The doc thinks it may be a total of 12 or 16 weeks before I am allowed to put weight on it. This is week 4 since the surgery.</p><p>In the meantime, I am drinking lots of milk and orange juice with calcium, taking vitamins, glucosamin chondroitin and doing the exercises to encourage the bones to grow. </p>

<p>Keep up the good work. You need every gram of calcium you can get because in a year or so your bones will have to support you while you chase KIrin around the house, yard, street, etc</p>

BODY:
<p>I went to the pediatrician with Mark and Kirin so I wouldnt be bored at home. She now weighs 7lbs 4 oz. She gained 12 oz over the week. She is also longer, 20 inches. Grow Baby Grow! </p><p>Then we went to Michael's craft store. I got some new beads, watercolor pencils, stamps, paper and envelopes. Now I just need Marky to print up more baby pictures for me. I am slowly making baby picture cards and sending them to family and friends. If you dont have one yet, dont panic! I plan to get one to everybody, but that will take some time. If you dont have one in 2-3 weeks, then remind me. The memory is a little fuzzy lately.</p><p>Kirin was very well behaved at the Dr's and at the store. Of course, we hurried to leave once she started looking fussy. But it was a successful outing. Except for Mark's wallet. I'll have to be content with the projects I have for another month at least!  : ) Kirin likes riding in the car. It puts her to sleep almost instantly. It's a little hard on Mark trying to get Mom and baby, wheelchair and stroller into the car, but he's pretty organized about it. Takes 10 mins to load or unload, but we can get out of the house now.</p>

BODY:
<p>One of our good friends from high school, Toni, came into Phx this weekend, and managed to get a bunch of us <a href="http://www.brophyprep.org/" target="_new">Brophy</a> / <a href="http://www.xcp.org/" target="_new">Xavier</a> (websites!  ha!) people together for drinks!  We had: Toni, Jayce, Ian, Dominic, Sarah, Adam, Angela, and Myself.  We had an awesome time.  We all met up at Dominic's house, which was semi frightening for me considering the last time I was there I managed to break his tooth.  Long story.  I half expected his parents to greet me saying "Hey we remember you, you knocked our kid's tooth out!" I was safe however, since Dominic's parents now spend the hot Phoenix summers in Ireland!</p><p></p><p>We all piled into cars and drove to a local bar where we talked and drank and ate, and drank, and talked, you get the idea.  After a few rounds it was back into the cars and back to Dom's house.  It was then that someone discovered the yearbooks.  Now it was horribly un-fair that only Brophy yearbooks were available, as the guys suffered through many hours of taunting.  We survived mostly by making fun of everyone who wasn't there. (Jason, <s>Jim</s> <a href="http://www.tackymagnet.com/" target="_new">Hart</a>, André, Mike, the list goes on...)  I must go find Angela's yearbooks...</p><p></p><p>Toni took pictures, and as soon as she gets them posted I will link to them here, so check back!</p><p></p><p>Here's to another decade!</p><p></p><p><b>THE PLAY!</b></p>

<p>It's my birthday time!  June 6<sup>th</sup> falls on a Wednesday this year, so I'm thinking about doing a party thing on the following Saturday, June 9<sup>th</sup>.  I don't think we're going to do a huge fancy party like we did for 30.  It's just too much work right now with a new baby and all.  So I'm thinking about doing just a rolling get together.  If you've been looking for a good excuse to come by and see Kirin, this is it!  I think we'll be ready for visitors by about 1pm, so any time after that, probably until 8pm or so, just stop by, say hi, have a drink, play some Warcraft etc.</p><p>My <a href="/wp/mark-birthday/">birthday list</a> is up on the side here, and <a href="http://www.machomestore.com/catalog/index.php">MacHomeStore.com</a> is having a Memorial Day sale on all the remote switch stuff.</p><p>Don't sweat presents and stuff, we're much happier with the visiting at this point.  I think we're both feeling a little cabin fever.  I've put up a <a href="/wp/map-to-house/map-to-our-house-on-eli-st/">map to our house</a> on the right side menu.</p>

BODY:
<p>Kirin went to the doctor last week and weighed in at 10 pounds. She is growing quickly. This puts her squarely in the 50th percentile for size. She also got a bunch of shots. Poor thing! She didn't like that much but she calmed down quickly. They gave her the cutest little spot band-aids! Every one smiles when they see Mark pushing my wheelchair while I push the baby stroller! Got to get a picture of that.</p><p>We all went to the orthopedist on Tuesday. The x-rays are looking good. The doc said I can walk while wearing my fancy boot and start physical therapy. HURRAY!! I have been walking about cautiously since then using my walker. I hope when I feel stronger and get used to walking again that I can get rid of the walker. Maybe use a cane instead. I feel like a granny! In physical therapy I get to play in the pool. I'll get to walk in the water without the boot! The doc hopes to get rid of the boot in another 4 weeks or so.</p><p>So now that I am up and moving around, I have to think about the full-time job offer I got from my favorite place to work. They say I can bring little Kirin to work with me. I just don't know how that will work out.</p><p>As for the big picture, things are looking better!</p>

Very sorry for the delay!  She's eating and growing fast. She's starting to sleep longer at night, averaging about 4 hours at a time.  That's up nicely from the two or two and a half hour blocks she was doing a week or so ago.  We've even gotten lucky a few nights with some six to eight hour blocks. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Mornings are the best time so far with her.  She's very attentive and happy.  We try and do our tummy time in the morning, so she can get a feel for her arms and legs under her, and pushing her head up.  She has a nice strong neck so far!  We'll see how long it is until she's making crawling motions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She's also nice and vocal in the morning.  That is to say, her vocalizations are nice and pleasant.  She makes plenty of noise all day long, just it gets progressively less pleasant as the day goes on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Late afternoons and evenings are a challenge right now.  She's starting to get tired, but won't sleep.  She seems to swing quickly from hungry, to cranky, to fussy, back to hungry, and then to cranky. It's usually a bit rough from 5 or so until she finally goes to sleep around 9.  Somewhere in there we find time to eat.  Usually. Bouncing her in our arms is about the only thing we can do to comfort her, but its hard to bounce her for 4 hours.  :)  <br/><br/><br/><br/>You can see more pictures at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/</a><br/></div></p>

<p>Angela goes to the doctor....again!</p><p>The leg is healing well. It needs to grow more bone and have more range of motion. I am permitted to walk short distances without the boot at home. Outside I am to use the boot and ditch the walker. Well, I am more than a little off balance so I have been using a cane. Indoors, without the boot, I am struggling and still need the walker. Despite all these rules, I am much more mobile, independent and feeling better.</p><p>Also on a positive note. I may return to work as early as August. The details are still kinda fuzzy but it sounds like part time at Sonoran Health Center. That's the best place I've worked in the past 4 years. They may even hire a friend of mine too! More on that as the story breaks.</p><p>Kirin is growing well and happy. She is occasionally sleeping 6 hours a night. Most nights its more like 4, 2 and 2. Those nights are kinda uncomfortable for the grown ups.  She is happy and talkative in the mornigs. That is usually when we play, squirm around, and talk to each other. In the afternoons she is fussy and tired and pretty loud about it. Yesterday she learned how to pout! She stuck out her lower lip, squinted her eyes and whined at Mark. It was terribly cute and funny. Then she got really mad because we were laughing at her.  She is truly starting to develop her own personality.</p>

BODY:
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a programmer.  However, the world of hardware has always intrigued me.  I&#8217;ve always been somewhat interested in the ability for electronics to actually *do* something in the real world, and not just push pixels around a screen.</p>
<p>I first heard about the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> micro-controller world on an episode of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://twit.tv/mbw81" target="_blank">MacBreak Weekly</a>.  <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://ihnatko.com/" target="_blank">Andy Ihnatko</a> was talking about it for an upcoming talk he was giving.  Basically the Arduino is an open-source micro-controller.  It connects to your PC via a USB port.  There&#8217;s a custom IDE built for it that runs on Macs, Windows and Linux.  The basic idea is that you can now easily control simple voltages on pins.  Connect them to sensors, motors, LEDs etc, and control the real world from a very easily accessible starting point.</p>
<p>So I finally got around to ordering the standard Arduino board, some sensors, a breadboard, and started playing.</p>
<p>An interesting concept with the Arduino world, is the idea of a &#8216;shield&#8217;.  Basically a shield is a board that fits on top of the base Arduino, and adds some functionality to the basic setup.  A proto-shield is just a shield that gives you a small space for prototyping.  The SparkFun shield also gives you a couple of LEDs with resistors in place, and some switches to play with.</p>
<p>The proto-shield comes as a kit, so I got to practice my soldering skills.  I had never really soldered on a board before, but after a few minutes of poking around, I eventually got the hang of it.  Shield assembled, I was amazed at how fast and easy it was to start getting readings from the ultrasonic sensor.  The following few lines of code were all that was needed to read the sensor value, and send it to a listening serial port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code> int sensorValue = 0;<br />int sensorPin = 1;<br /><br />void setup() { <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial.begin(9600);<br />}<br /><br />void loop() {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial.println(sensorValue);<br />}</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The input / output pins on the Arduino board are all numbered, so you just pick a pin, hook up your sensors, and you&#8217;re off!</p>
<p>Once I figured out how to get reliable readings from the sensor, I figured a simple thing to build would be a system to see if I was at my desk or not.</p>
<p>I pulled the parts off the protoshield, and built a more permanent set of boxes.  One box for the Arduino, and another for the sensor.  This let me position the sensor in an appropriate spot, and allowed me to plug the Arduino box into a USB port.</p>

<p>The two buttons let me set the range at which the sensor will trigger an &#8220;Away&#8221; or &#8220;Here&#8221; message back to the computer.  A simple program running on my mac then picks up the signal from the Arduino, and relays it to a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://misc.mark.webdev.oscr.arizona.edu/processing/markdesk2.php" target="_blank">web service that then tracks my presence</a>.</p>

<p>Playing around with silly electronics again.  This time the idea is to put twinkling stars on the ceiling of our bedroom.  I&#8217;m using two <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/TLC5940" target="_blank">TLC5940</a> chips to drive LEDs.  The chips are capable of 16 channels of <a title="Definition of PWM" href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM" target="_blank">PWM</a>, so the stars can fade on and off nicely.  <br /><br />Step 1 was a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/3430007221/" target="_blank">proof of concept</a>.  Could I figure out how to hook up one of these chips to an Arduino, and get it to fade some LEDs on and off? Fortunately, the Arduino community is amazing, and someone has already written a fantastic library for this chip. (Thanks <a title="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1218174457" href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1218174457" target="_blank">acleone</a>!) The documentation on how to hook the chips up is all defined very nicely in the comments of the example programs in the library.</p>

<p>Once I had a single chip working on a breadboard, it was time to plan out a more&nbsp;permanent&nbsp;board to house two chips. &nbsp;Two chips gives me 32 stars, which I figured was enough to start with. &nbsp;In order to fit the chips on the shield, I changed the transfer mode from SPI to bitbang inside of tlc_config.h, this let me just move from pins 11 and 13 over to 4 and 7, and let me squeeze in the TLCs right next to the arduino connector pins.</p>
<p>I changed the&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;resistor on the chip from 2k&Omega; to 100k&Omega;. &nbsp;The white LEDs I&#8217;m using are just way too bright with only 2k&Omega; of resistance. &nbsp;100k knocks the brightness down to an acceptable level.</p>
<p>Next I need to start getting serious about wiring up a bunch of LEDs and start sticking them to my ceiling. &nbsp;I also have to figure out an elegant way of bringing in 30+ very thin wires and connecting them to their appropriate pins.</p>

<p>Wow, it is really hard to register a complaint with Apple. Good job hiding any ability to contact Apple behind a maze of distracting options.</p>
<p>Why does <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?9,651569,651569#msg-651569" target="_blank">Apple reject an app like nin: access for &#8216;objectionable&#8217; material</a>, when the same objectionable material is accessible through mobile Safari, or the iTunes music store? If Apple wants to continue to push the iPhone / iPod Touch platform as a true mobile computer, it must relinquish arbitrary and artificial restrictions like this. This is my device, and I will put whatever content I want to on it. Up to now I&#8217;ve been able to do that without resorting to jailbreaking. If this is no longer true, I will have to look at the alternatives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a pretty happy Apple customer for decades now, but the arbitrary social restrictions Apple is imposing on this device have me very unsettled. I will not be purchasing any upgrades to this platform unless this situation changes.</p>
<p>I do not need Apple to protect me from the evils of the world. Please leave that up to parents and adults.</p>
<p>You cannot censor the internet.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />Mark Fischer</p>

BODY:
<p>With Kirin&#8217;s increasing love affair with Elmo, we decided to bite the bullet and get a new TV. Our old TV we got when we first got married, so I figure eleven years is a good run for a TV.</p>
<p>We were replacing an old 28&#8221; CRT TV that had a G5 iMac hooked up to it. The iMac was really starting to struggle with playback on full screen h264 movies, so we decided to replace that as well. To be honest, we actually set out to only replace the iMac, but we got side tracked&#8230;</p>
<p>We decided to get a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" target="_blank">Mac Mini</a> as the basis for the setup. The new Minis are a pretty decent setup for a home theater PC. Its small, its quiet, and it doesn&#8217;t look half bad in the living room. We got the Mac Mini home only to discover that I needed a new cable&#8230; a quick trip back to the store, cable in hand, home again. This time I was beset by our biggest setback.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="IMG_2602 by estranged42, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/3610104074/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3596/3610104074_dc5f0a99bd.jpg" alt="IMG_2602" width="500" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>The old CRT TV only had a coax RF input. I had an RCA -&gt; RF converterbox already, and was planning on just going from the Mini&#8217;s DVI port -&gt; DVI to Video Adaptor -&gt; RCA to RF adaptor -&gt; TV. However, it turns out that the Mac Mini, and likely all future PCs, can no longer output a standard analog video signal. Why is this? Simply put, the MPAA has managed to con the graphics card makers, the PC makers, congress, and most of America into thinking that analog signals = piracy. Sigh.</p>
<p>So no I was faced with either returning the Mini, or going full bore and getting a new TV. I needed a TV capable of either DVI or HDMI inputs. Pretty much any new flat panel TV these days has those inputs, so it was time to buy a new TV.</p>
<p>We got a Samsung 32&#8221; LCD TV, got Jeff to come help hang it on the wall (out of Kirin&#8217;s reach!), and were finally able to hook the Mini up, and enjoy high def goodness.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_2598 by estranged42, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/3610103762/"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3314/3610103762_23696c95e8.jpg" alt="IMG_2598" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Apple ships most computers with a tiny remote, I got one with my last MacBook from work. For some reason, they don&#8217;t ship one with the Mini however. Seems strange, since a lot of people seem to buy the Mini to use as a home theater PC. Anyhow, I had a remote already, pointed it at the TV, and was off into Front Row, Apple&#8217;s media center software. Once I had iTunes and iPhoto hooked up to my media library, (Yay for external drives, and symbolic links!) Front Row saw all our music, movies and photos. Digitizing movies and putting them into iTunes is a bit of a lengthy chore, but its very worth it. I never have to go hunting for a disc when <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we</span>Kirin wants to watch Elmo. Just punch up Front Row, scroll through the list of movies, and press play.</p>
<p>The realsurprisein all of this came last week when <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.hulu.com/labs/hulu-desktop" target="_blank">Hulu released their desktop app</a>. I was pleasantly surprised when they announce that it would run on both Windows and Mac OS X. I downloaded it, installed it, signed in with my Hulu account, and in minutes I was watching shows from my queue right on the new TV. I&#8217;ll say this right now. Cable andSatelliteTV are dead. Within five years, the majority of &#8216;television&#8217; will be video on demand, streamed to you over your only remaining communication utility: broadband internet.</p>
<p>We had one small snag in the remote department. With two main applications, Front Row and Hulu, Apple&#8217;s simplistic remote couldn&#8217;t handle launching different apps. Fortunately, the people at iospirit make a really great program called <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.iospirit.com/" target="_blank">Remote Buddy</a>. It&#8217;s basically a highly configurable menu system that is controllable by remote, and is nice and large, perfect for a home theater PC setup. A little configuration in that, and I&#8217;m able to easily choose between Hulu and Front Row. The bonus is I can control a lot more on the Mac also. iPhoto is right there, and has some really stunning slideshows now. Having a 32&#8221; video picture frame is pretty cool. We have some Airpot Express modules around the house doing the Airtunes thing. However for someunfathomablereason Front Row doesn&#8217;t support streaming music to airtunes speakers. It works fine from iTunes, so Remote Buddy lets me jump into iTunes also with ease.</p>
<p>Final touches involved getting a shelf to put all the electronics on. &nbsp;We still need to get some conduits to hide the cables running to and from the Mac.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a title="IMG_2603 by estranged42, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fischco/3609291429/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3663/3609291429_e924bbb006.jpg" alt="IMG_2603" width="500" height="210" /></a></span></span></p>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;m really happy with the setup. &nbsp;I really like having the iPhoto slideshow up. &nbsp;Its great to be able to enjoy your photo library on a day to day basis, without having to sit in front of a computer. &nbsp;Just turn the slide show on and wander around the house. &nbsp;We still don&#8217;t watch that much television, but what we do watch is now easy and more enjoyable. &nbsp;Pretty happy with the setup. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying out <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com">Bazaar</a>, a version control system, lately. &nbsp;One of the things that caught my eye is that the core team develops a cross platform GUI interface for the system. &nbsp;Installing bzr itself was pretty straight forward, they even have a simple Mac OS X installer package for it. &nbsp;Installing the GUI tools was&#8230; less intuitive.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/qbzr/+question/10213">really basic instructions</a> out there on how to do it, but the documentation is <a href="http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/explorer/en/tutorials/foss-contribute.html">somewhat lacking in specifics</a>. &nbsp;Fortunately there&#8217;s a great project out there called <a href="http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/MacPorts">macports</a> that was able to do 98% of the work for me.</p>
<p>The last 2% came down to two errors involving path info, or the lack there of. &nbsp;The GUI parts are all written in Python, on top of Qt. Adding the following lines to my .profile file fixed several hours of frustration in terms of &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you work!&#8221;</p>
<p><code>export DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks:${DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH} <br />export PYTHONPATH=/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/:${PYTHONPATH}</code></p>
<div></div>
<p>Gotta love free tools, but whew, they aren&#8217;t always the easiest things to install&#8230;</p>

<p class="flickr-yourcomment">After nearly a year, I finally finished up putting LED &#8216;stars&#8217; onto our bedroom ceiling. See this <a href="/blog/2009/4/10/putting-stars-on-our-ceiling.html">earlier post where I talk about getting it started</a>.</p>
<p class="flickr-yourcomment">After a lot of soldering and taping, I managed to tape 32 white LEDs to the ceiling of our bedroom, and get stars working. &nbsp;I tried a bunch of different wiring ideas out before settling on simple bare buss wire. &nbsp;I just put some white electrical tape to keep it in place, and tape over any place where the lines have to cross. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="flickr-yourcomment">The affect is really pretty awesome with the room dark. &nbsp;There are just enough stars lit at any one time to barely light the room, but not so bright that you can&#8217;t fall asleep with them twinkling.</p>

<p>I got my first printed circuit board (PCB) design in the mail today.  This is for a pretty simple blinking LED project.  <br /> <br /> When <a href="http://uits.arizona.edu">UITS got its new logo</a>, the dancing circuit people just screamed out to be made into a real PCB somehow.  This is what I came up with.  I realize using a full <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> ATMega168 is a bit overkill for driving some LEDs, but I decided that I&#8217;d rather get a prototype working this year instead of deciphering datasheets for the smaller ATtiny series for the next 6 months. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is to just have the color changing LEDs fade between red and blue in various patterns.  Pushing the button will cycle through a couple different blink patterns.<br /> <br /> I got these boards printed at <a href="http://www.batchpcb.com">BatchPCB</a>.  If you&#8217;re only wanting 1 or 2 small boards, they&#8217;re hard to beat for price.  $45 for two boards, and they ended up sending me 4!  Took about 20 days for them to get here, but they look great!</p>

<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Well, I populated the circuit board tonight, soldered up all the components, tossed in some batteries, and flipped the switch!<br /> <br /> And nothing happened.<br /> <br /> After ten minutes or so poking at the traces with my multimeter, I discovered that I have one trace out of place leading into the power switch.  Fortunately a simple jumper from one pin to another on the switch was able to fix the problem.  And it worked!<br /> <br /> I have to admit, this thing looks pretty damn good!  Not too shabby for my first PCB layout and project.  I think I started toying around with this design over a year ago, so it&#8217;s pretty cool to actually hold a real, physical, blinking thing in my hands.</p>

<p>I ran into an bothersome problem with PHP&#8217;s <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.soapserver.php">SoapServer</a> class this week.  Here&#8217;s what I wanted as output from the server:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&gt;
   &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
      &lt;locationCollection&gt;

            &lt;name&gt;AME s438&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;452&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;latitude&gt;32.236322&lt;/latitude&gt;
            &lt;longitude&gt;-110.951614&lt;/longitude&gt;
         &lt;/Location&gt;
         &lt;Location&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;ECE 229&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;45&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;latitude&gt;32.235069&lt;/latitude&gt;
            &lt;longitude&gt;-110.953417&lt;/longitude&gt;
         &lt;/Location&gt;
      &lt;/locationCollection&gt;
   &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However what I was getting instead was: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&gt;
   &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
      &lt;locationCollection&gt;
         &lt;SOAP-ENC:Struct&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;AME s438&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;452&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;latitude&gt;32.236322&lt;/latitude&gt;
            &lt;longitude&gt;-110.951614&lt;/longitude&gt;
         &lt;/SOAP-ENC:Struct&gt;
         &lt;SOAP-ENC:Struct&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;ECE 229&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;45&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;latitude&gt;32.235069&lt;/latitude&gt;
            &lt;longitude&gt;-110.953417&lt;/longitude&gt;
         &lt;/SOAP-ENC:Struct&gt;
      &lt;/locationCollection&gt;
   &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here was my original code for the server:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$wsdl = 'http://example.com/locations_service.wsdl';
$service = new SoapServer($wsdl);

$service-&gt;addFunction('getComputerLabs');
$service-&gt;handle();

function getComputerLabs($input) {
  $all_locations = resource::get_all(FALSE, 'location');

  $return_array = array();

  foreach ($all_locations as $l) {

    // Build a basic return object.
    $new_loc = new Location();
    $new_loc-&gt;name = $l-&gt;name;
    $new_loc-&gt;id = $l-&gt;resource_id;
    $new_loc-&gt;latitude = $l-&gt;getProperty('Latitude');
    $new_loc-&gt;longitude = $l-&gt;getProperty('Longitude');

    $return_array[] = $new_loc;
  }

  return $return_array;
}

class Location {
    public $name;
    public $id;
    public $description;
    public $url;
    public $buildingName;
    public $roomNumber;
    public $openStatus;
    public $latitude;
    public $longitude;
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently the SOAP library really prefers that everything is an object.  In php 5 they added an <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.arrayobject.php">ArrayObject</a> class.  This coupled with a SoapVar call fixed my output for me.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
function getComputerLabs($input) {
  $all_locations = resource::get_all(FALSE, 'location');

  /**
   * Use an ArrayObject instead of a plain array.
   */
  $return_array = new ArrayObject();

  foreach ($all_locations as $l) {

    // Build a basic return object.
    $new_loc = new Location();
    $new_loc-&gt;name = $l-&gt;name;
    $new_loc-&gt;id = $l-&gt;resource_id;
    $new_loc-&gt;latitude = $l-&gt;getProperty('Latitude');
    $new_loc-&gt;longitude = $l-&gt;getProperty('Longitude');

    /**
     * Encode each array element with SoapVar.  Parameter 5 is the name of the
     * XML element you want to use.  This only seems to work within
     * an ArrayObject.
     */
    $new_loc = new SoapVar($new_loc, SOAP_ENC_OBJECT, null, null, 'Location');

    $return_array-&gt;append($new_loc);
  }

  return $return_array;
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that with only the ArrayObject part, and before I figured out the SoapVar wrapper, I was getting this interesting BOGUS tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&gt;
   &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
      &lt;locationCollection&gt;
         &lt;BOGUS&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;AME s438&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;452&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;latitude&gt;32.236322&lt;/latitude&gt;
            &lt;longitude&gt;-110.951614&lt;/longitude&gt;
         &lt;/BOGUS&gt;
         &lt;BOGUS&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;ECE 229&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;45&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;latitude&gt;32.235069&lt;/latitude&gt;
            &lt;longitude&gt;-110.953417&lt;/longitude&gt;
         &lt;/BOGUS&gt;
      &lt;/locationCollection&gt;
   &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

BODY:
<p>A recent topic thread on <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/66" title="Hypercritical">Hypercritical with John Siracusa</a> has been trying to answer the question &#8220;are video games an artform where its not possible for a large part of society to enjoy them fully because they lack the appropriate skill&#8221;. The example being a first person game where the player can&#8217;t enjoy the game because they lack the skill to simple move around the environment and understand the controls.</p>

<p>I only want to talk about a small part of this larger discussion. I agree with the premise that &#8220;a large number of people lack the skills to enjoy certain games fully.&#8221; Where I disagree with John is when we states that &#8220;it&#8217;s not possible for these people to gain the skills&#8221;.</p>

<p>First I want to define a few terms, so that we can be clear on them.</p>

<p>Skill: The ability to perform a given task to a sufficient level. An example of a skill would be the ability to write, to speak French, to talk, to dance, etc.</p>

<p>Talent: A natural ability that cannot be learned. An example of a talent is being 7 feet tall, being a musical savant, having a beautiful voice, etc.</p>

<p>I have three ideas to introduce that I don&#8217;t think were covered much in the discussion.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Skill can be learned by spending time working on it. </p></li>
<li><p>Talent affects how much time must be spent to learn a skill. </p></li>
<li><p>Motivation affects the probability that a given individual will spend the required time to learn a skill.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So in the context of games, it may require some people more time than others to gain sufficient skill to fully appreciate the it. Those with more tallent will spend less time that those with less talent, but given sufficient time, both individuals will end up with the same skill level. Now if the person with less talent is not motivated to acquire the skill, they will give up early and not get the skill.</p>

<p>However the main factor governing the number of people who have the required skill is not some innate thing, it is not talent. The governing factors are time and motivation. There are undoubtedly a group of people with so little talent that it is effectively impossible for them to acquire the skill. For gaming though, I think that most people do have the talents required to learn the skills. What keeps people from actually learning the skills is that A) they just don&#8217;t want to (lack of motivation) or B) they just don&#8217;t have the time.</p>

<p>The end effect is the same, but the proposition that &#8220;it&#8217;s not possible for these people to gain the skills&#8221; is false. A better proposition might be &#8220;it&#8217;s not probable for these people to gain the skills&#8221;.</p>

<p>Marc Scott wrote a thought provoking article over at <a href="http://www.rootstrikers.org">coding2learn.org</a> called &#8220;<a href="http://www.coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/">Kids Can&#8217;t Use Computers&#8230; And This Is Why It Should Worry You</a>&#8221; a few weeks ago.  It&#8217;s a really well reasoned article, and you should go read it if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p>

<p>As I was reading through the article, I kept thinking to myself &#8220;Yeah, this guy has it nailed.  All these people out there have no idea how to use a computer. We should really educate them more on general computer use.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, after reading through some of the comments (there are many) and thinking about it some more, I began to disagree with his ultimate conclusion more and more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want the people who will help shape our society in the future to understand the technology that will help shape out society in the future. If this is going to happen, then we need to reverse the trend that is seeing digital illiteracy exponentially increase. We need to act together, as parents, as teachers, as policy makers. Lets build a generation of hackers. Who’s with me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there are two main points that are not being considered.</p>

<p><strong>Blame the user</strong></p>

<p>This sounds like a great rallying cry. Let&#8217;s teach the users so they can be more digitally literate!</p>

<p>It sounds good, but the more I think of it, the more it actually sounds like an old refrain in the technology world.</p>

<p>Blame the user.</p>

<p>One of Mr. Scott&#8217;s examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A kid puts his hand up. He tells me he’s got a virus on his computer. I look at his screen. Displayed in his web-browser is what appears to be an XP dialogue box warning that his computer is infected and offering free malware scanning and removal tools. He’s on a Windows 7 machine. I close the offending tab. He can’t use a computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He presents several other anecdotes about how people can&#8217;t use computers.</p>

<p>The automobile is often used as an example of how things have gotten worse with respects to technology.  Marc mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hundred years ago, if you were lucky enough to own a car then you probably knew how to fix it. People could at least change the oil, change the tyres, or even give the engine a tune-up. I’ve owned a car for most of my adult life and they’re a mystery to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Years ago you could throw a cup of gas right into your carburetor if it had trouble starting. However, this is not an example of how things were better when people knew more about cars.  This is an example of the automobile industry&#8217;s <em>failure to build a reliable engine.</em></p>

<p>Similarly, the fact that Mr. Scott&#8217;s student is confused about a possible computer virus is not an example of how the student would be better off if only he knew how to use a computer. This is an example of the technology industry&#8217;s <em>failure to build a secure computing environment.</em></p>

<p><strong>Division of Labor</strong></p>

<p>We live in an incredibly complex society.  There&#8217;s the old adage of &#8220;Give someone a fish, and you feed them for a day. Teach someone to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

<p>I used to think this way a lot back in my desktop support days. If only I could just educate my users more about how a hierarchical directory system worked, then they wouldn&#8217;t loose their files.  If only my users better understood the mental model of relating to buttons, icons, documents, and links, then they wouldn&#8217;t be so confused about when to double-click things, or when to click and drag, or when to single click.</p>

<p>If only I could better educate my users, everything would be better.</p>

<p>However this idea leaves out one thing.</p>

<p>Time.</p>

<p>One day I was talking to a professor at the university I was doing tech support for. She was really angry that something wasn&#8217;t working with her computer, and complained that she was doctor of some such discipline, and how should she be expected to know all this stuff about computers.</p>

<p>At the time, I simply suppressed my initial reaction of how spoiled university faculty were, of how they should really get with the times and really learn how to use a computer.</p>

<p>Years later however, I think back on that and realize that she was right.</p>

<p>She was an incredibly talented faculty member. She had been a practicing clinician for decades. She has spent tens of thousands of hours in her chosen field to become an expert.</p>

<p>She understands the division of labor.</p>

<p>Its an old economic theory, but somehow I think the technology industry overlooks it.</p>

<p>This faculty member&#8217;s computer was broken. She called in a technology expert to fix it. I did, and she was happy.</p>

<p>My car is broken. I call in an automotive expert to fix it. They do. I&#8217;m happy.</p>

<p>I am hungry. I call upon an agricultural expert to grow food. They do. I&#8217;m happy.</p>

<p>Somehow technology experts, having grown up in technology, and having spent tens of thousands of hours becoming an expert in it, are surprised when other people choose to specialize in other areas.</p>

<p>We simply cannot be experts in everything. We can&#8217;t even be pretty good at everything. We have to decide what we will be good at, and what we will depend upon others to do for us. The fact that so many people depend on Mr. Scott for technology support is no different than the fact that I depend upon the city to provide me with clean drinking water. I don&#8217;t want to be an expert in well drilling and water purification.</p>

<p>Marc <a href="http://www.rootstrikers.org">quotes Cory Doctorow</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are no airplanes, only computers that fly. There are no cars, only computers we sit in. There are no hearing aids, only computers we put in our ears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Computers are absolutely pervasive in our society. And Marc&#8217;s points about lawmakers making decisions about an industry they don&#8217;t understand is troubling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tomorrow’s politicians, civil servants, police officers, teachers, journalists and CEOs are being created today. These people don’t know how to use computers, yet they are going to be creating laws regarding computers, enforcing laws regarding computers, educating the youth about computers, reporting in the media about computers and lobbying politicians about computers. Do you thinks this is an acceptable state of affairs? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However this shouldn&#8217;t be any more troubling than any other industry that lawmakers don&#8217;t understand. They depend on experts to tell them what they don&#8217;t know.  The fact that the experts are usually provided by lobbyists from the highest bidder is what should scare us.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re worried about where our society is going in the future, worry more about how to get money out of politics. Spend your time involved in something like <a href="http://www.rootstrikers.org">rootstrikers.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Make the future better</strong></p>

<p>All of the examples Mr. Scott cites in his article should be seen as a call to action. However the call to action here shouldn&#8217;t be that we need to better educate people on technology. The call to action is for all of us in the technology industry to get off our butts and make the future better.</p>
